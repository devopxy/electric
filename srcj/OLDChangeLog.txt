BUG: (6/25/07, SAF) PIE: If only one instance of a part exists it was
     automatically matched by local partitioning without verifying proper
     interchange.

     used in Technology.getShapeOfNodes/Arcs methods.

IMP: (10/24/06, DN) Extended API of immutable classes EPoint, ERectangle,
     ImmutableArcInst. They have getters and factory methods in double lambda
     units and in long grid units. Grid units are long in API, but they are
     restricted to "int" range in current implementation. Additional memory cost
     is 8 bytes per EPoint. Alternative ECoord implementation is possible, which
     is more memory efficient, but a little slower.

BUG: (10/23/06, DN) Short arcs in TechPalette (Bug #1250).
FIX: In ArcProto.getShapeOfDummyArc swap end coordinates, so that arc's angle is

     confusing/inconsistent (Bug# 1245)
FIX: Technology tab in project preferences was re-organized. For MoCMOS tech, the
     feature size is included as part of the panel title.

BUG: (10/20/06, GVG) Exception in TechPalette if Mosis is chosen and you select
     min or aligned primitives (TSMC180)

FIX: Keep info about expanded nodes on a Cell.

IMP: (10/16/06, GVG) Skeleton to read DSPF

IMP: (10/16/06, DN) Connectivity index was moved to immutable CellBackup.
     Now database has less memory size, because it doesn't keep Connection.
     However, "ArcInst.getConnection", "NodeInst.getConnections",
     "PortInst.getConnections" are slower, because they allocate temporary
     Connections.

BUG: (10/12/06, SMR) Wiring a port to itself crashes (Bug #1242).
FIX: In Router.createRouteNoJob(), make sure route.getStart() is valid.

IMP: (10/11/06, GVG) More min contact primitives for node extraction.

IMP: (10/11/06, DN) "CellBackup" has index of exports sorted by original node.

     section of the Printing Preferences.

BUG: (10/3/06, SMR) Routing node to arc may crash.  Reporting sometimes bad.
FIX: Moved reporting from Routing.createRouteNoJob() to
     Routing.reportRoutingResults().

     modification loops. Future refactoring for memory saving will make these
     methods slower when called after Cell modification.

IMP: (9/28/06, GVG) Enable zoom via selection area (Bug #135). Indeed, entire
     tool bar was disabled because the scenegraph is displayed in its own frame
     and it is not worth it to hack it.  Solution only valid for SDI mode.

BUG: (9/28/06, DN) NCC regressions fail when cell group has multiple schematics.
FIX: In Cell.CellGroup.setMainSchematic use first schematic cell.
     In Cell.checkAndRepair issue warnings about extraneous schematic cells.

BUG: (9/28/06, DN) A lot of warnings during Nodable deserialization.
FIX: In EObjectOutputStream.ENodable.readResolve use getNetlist() instead of

     maintains uniqueness of these names. This will be used for reading isolated
     CellBackups for DELIB library/cell updates. Artifact: Renamed cells and
     cells of renamed libraries are not linked to the database. New objects are
     created instead.

IMP: (09/12/05, SMR) Complete rewrite of display code.  New module, "VectorDrawing.java"
     caches low-level graphics for each cell, allowing caches to be "played-back" rapidly.
     Has better performance than "PixelDrawing" which caches expanded cell images.
     Does not need to recache when zoom scale changes, layer visibility changes, etc.
     Only downside is that cache creation is slow when large chip is first fully-instantiated.

BUG: (09/11/05, DN) Slow display (Bug #537).
FIX: In PixelDrawing make maxObjectSize and halfMaxObjectSize static (they were 0 in cache cells).

    for use in our async group, for better integration with tools here.

IMP: (09/09/05, JKG) Option to convert Export names when writing GDS if NCC
    annotation 'exportsConnectedByParent' is present. This asserts a virtual connection
    between networks that have exports matching the annotation. Other CAD tools provide
    this functionality, but only match names that have a ':' in them and match exactly.
    This option renames those exports to all the same name with a ':' in them so other
    tools can provide the same functionality as 'exportsConnectedByParent'.

BUG: (09/09/05, DN) JELIB reader reads only last decimal digit of tech-specific bits.
     For example, it corrupts PortCharacteristic of Global-Signal instances.
FIX: In io.input.JELIB.instantiateCellContents line 868 put "break parseStateInfo;" into loop parsing NodeInst's sateInfo .

IMP: (09/09/05, DN) Wiped bit is not stored to library files, because it is computed form database.
    So 'W' and 'E' bits are not written to JELIB node inst lines more.

BUG: (09/09/05, DN) Expand cell instances should not modify referenced library (Bug #366).
FIX: Expand instance bits are no more part of database. They are user preferences,
     which are saved to registry on Quit. Unfortunately, they are not undoable now.
     OBJECTREDRAW in Undo doesn't set cell modified flag, so expand cells doesn't touch
     Cell explorer.

IMP: (09/07/05, JKG) Added max series resistance option under parasitics.
     This breaks long single PI models into series of distributed PI models.

BUG: (09/09/05, DN) Mirroring not correct on icons *Bug #531).

     and the nets are the same, do not flag an error.

TEC: (1/3/03) Modified "Metal-1-P-Well-Con" and "Metal-1-N-Well-Con" in "mocmos" technology so that
     they always have 12x12 well.  As an efficiency measure, they used to have smaller wells (11x11
     or 10x10 if using alternate contact rules), but this causes minimum size violations.  The
     wells are now irregular (not symmetric about the center) so that rotation can offer compaction.

IMP: (1/3/03) LEF input can now handle metal layers that say "met1" instead of "metal1" and
     "via" or "via2" instead of "via12" and "via23".  It can also handle "POWER" in macros.

		dia->dlgresaddr->windowRect.right = r.right+gra_winoffright;
		dia->dlgresaddr->windowRect.top = r.top+gra_winofftop;
		dia->dlgresaddr->windowRect.bottom = r.bottom+gra_winoffbottom;
     to:
		wid = dia->dlgresaddr->windowRect.right - dia->dlgresaddr->windowRect.left;
		hei = dia->dlgresaddr->windowRect.bottom - dia->dlgresaddr->windowRect.top;

     "mocmos_intnodeEpolys()" instead of "tech_nodeEpolys()".  In "mocmos_shapeEnodepoly()",
     and "mocmos_allnodeEpolys()", call "mocmos_intshapeEnodepoly()" instead of "tech_shapeEnodepoly()".
     Also, in "tecmocmos.c:mocmos_tnas_l[]", set the port of the last two entries to "-1", not "1".

BUG: (7/22/02) Cannot move attributes on an export if those attributes are code.
FIX: In "usrmisc.c:us_modifytextdescript()", chage "high->fromvar" to "var" in the call
     to "modifydescript()" associated with exports.

BUG: (7/19/02) Auto-stitcher may crash.
FIX: In "routauto.c:ro_checkstitching()", must gather all polygons at once (using
     "allnodeEpolys()" instead of doing it one-at-a-time because "ro_findsmallestlayer()"
     also examines polygons.

IMP: (JG, 7/19/02) "sim/simspice.c" and "sim/sim.c" Added option to write transistors
     sizes in lambda, outputs scaling factor into spice deck if doing so.

     relevant menus.  Also, in "usrmenu.c:us_drawmenuentry()", increased the menu arc
     width, make sure arcs are longer than they are wide, and scale wide arcs differently
     from normal size arcs.

IMP: (7/18/02) Changes to relevant fields in "NCC Control and Options" dialog causes
     valid NCC date information to be cleared.

BUG: (7/18/02) When a rotated facet is erased, displayble variables are not undrawn right.
FIX: In "usrdisp.c:us_drawnodeinst()", when undrawing a facet, the results of "us_getnodebounds()"
     are already rotated for the node, so transformation "prevtrans" goes too far.
     Also, in "dbvars.c:makedisparrayvarpoly()", (centerobjx,centerobjy) must be rotated if
     on a node.

IMP: (JG, 7/18/02) "sim/simspice.c:markuniquenodeinsts" now works properly.

     equivalent by default.  Also added technology request options to make the ends differ.
     Only SPICE needs to see them as different, so modified "simspice.c" to check for resistors,
     and redo network numbering if they are found.  Modified NCC to ignore resistors and
     capacitors when both ends of the resistor are on the same net.

     This is now changed to 3.

BUG: (4/3/02) MOCMOS active contacts should have a well surround of 5 lambda in SCMOS, not 6.
FIX: (TECHNOLOGY CHANGE!) Modified technology in "tecmocmos.c".  Before, rule 2.3
     was properly used to change the well surround to 5 in the SCMOS rule set.  However,
     implementation of rule 6.2 overrode this computation.  Now rule 6.2 has checks
     for the process type as well.

     where the numbers are different).

BUG: (DN, 3/25/02) Spaces are still lost on Qt in messages window, because "QTextEdit scroll"
     treats them as commands.
FIX: In "graphqt.cpp:MessagesMainWindow::eventFilter" spaces are ignored before sending to
     "scroll", so that Qt passes them to MessagesMainWindow::keyPressEvent later.

BUG: (3/5/02) DRC gives erroneous active spacing error when two transistors bend.
FIX: (TECHNOLOGY CHANGE!) Modified technology in "tecmocmos.c".  Before, the Active area
     of a transistor was broken into two pieces for DRC purposes: each piece being on one
     half of the transistor.  The two pieces met in the middle.  Because of this, it was
     possible for the middle ground to be too close to some other object.
     Also, the polysilicon part of a transistor used to be all 1 piece, called "transistor-poly"
     which is treated differently than field-poly.  The problem here is that this poly
     includes the "tabs" of poly sticking out of the gate, which are not transistor-poly.
     Now, the Active area is in two pieces, but they stop at the gate edge.  There are three
     pieces of poly defined: transistor-poly that is only in the crossing area, and two plain
     poly (field poly) that convers only the tabs.
     The only detail associated with this is rule 5.4, which used to measure poly-cut to
     active, and now measures poly-cut to transistor-poly.
     An additional detail that needs to be handled is the routine "logeffort.c:le_analyzenetwork()"
     which handles the "Tools/Logical Effort/Analyze Network" command and must accumulate gate
     area properly.

IMP: (DN, 9/10/01) Added snapshot of Electric port to use Trolltech Qt library.
     Qt intended to be one more window system supported by Electric (now these are
     X11, MS Windows and Mac). It is contained in graphqt.h and graphqt.cpp. These
     files are derived from graphunixx11.c. Now this port is a mixture of Qt and Motif
     calls, and some functions are disabled at all. To try it, uncomment four lines in

BUG: Adding new exports to a schematic doesn't always create the right type of
     pin in the icon (doesn't follow "Icon Options" rules).
FIX: In "usrnet.c:us_makenewportproto()", use the same pin selection and sizing
     code as in "us_makeiconfacet()".

BUG: If bus export has width changed, instances of that facet may have wrong-width
     connections.

     that arc is not highlighted on the display.
FIX: In "usrdiacom.c:us_getinfonode", must call "us_showallhighlight()" and
     "us_endchanges()" before "us_getinfoarc()".

BUG: After simulation deck generation, unnamed bus arcs generate spurious
     error messages about inconsistent width.

     Modified dialogs to handle new fields.

BUG: Undo of modification to C-structure array variables (something that is probably
     never done) crashes.
FIX: In "dbchange.c:db_reversechange()", in the "VARIABLEMOD" case, must call
     "changedvariablename()" with "p3" as the last argument, not "p4".

IMP: When shift is held down but nothing is selected, area-selection is forced.

BUG: Doing "undo" to text editor after it starts removes entire buffer.
FIX: In "usreditpac.c:us_editpacaddline()", "us_editpacreplaceline()", and
     "us_editpacdeleteline()" must clear the TEXTTYPED bit from the editor state.

IMP: Multi-object "Get Info" dialog now allows you to remove items from selection.

FIX: In "simverilog.c", use proper MOS transistor names, use "supply" statement,
     and instantiate busses properly.

IMP: Replaced NCC engine with one that is similar to "Gemini".
     Required that each primitive node have unique NETWORK objects on its
     primitive ports (changed "network.c:net_redoprim()").

BUG: UNIX popups may grow too wide and obscure other items in the dialog.
FIX: In "graphunixx11.c:DiaSetPopup()", force the entries to their predefined width.

		if (line < first || line > first+visible)
     to:
		if (line < first || line >= first+visible)

     "usrdiacom.c:us_defarcdlog()/us_defnodedlog()" use fractional values
     instead of lambda values.

BUG: SPICE output complains about the active in well contacts.
FIX: In "simspice.c:sim_spicewritefacet()" in the "miscellaneous checks"
     section, ignore nets that are "sim_spice_power" or "sim_spice_ground".

BUG: May crash when reading libraries.
FIX: In "drc.c:dr_unqueuecheck()", be sure the parent is valid before
     finding its library.

IMP: Added text search-and-replace facility.

IMP: Added ability to center arrays.

BUG: When autorouting, prefered arc may obscure routing possibilities
FIX: In "routauto.c:ro_checkstitching()", must check prefered arc followed
     by all others.

BUG: PostScript output may generate zero-sized text.
FIX: In "iopsout.c:io_pstext()", quit if font is zero.

IMP: Skeletonization now connects electrically-equivalent ports.

BUG: Multiple facet-centers can be placed without warning.
FIX: Created "usrmisc.c:us_addfacetcenter()" to queue facet center creation
     and modified "usrmisc.c:us_doubchanges()" to check for duplicates.

IMP: Modified multi-object "Get Info" dialog to sort and enumerate objects
     in the list.

BUG: TrueType text may take too long to display.
FIX: In "usrwindow.c:us_writetext()", when determining proper font, must calculate
     proper font from excess size.

IMP: Elapsed time is now expressed in minutes and hours (if appropriate).

IMP: Added option to "mocmossub" technology to use "deep" or "scmos" rules.

IMP: Added ability to set transistors "weak" in ALS simulator.  Added weak
     transistor functions in "simalsuser.c".  Added proper ALS network generation
     for these in "vhdlals.c:vhdl_genals()".  Added code in "vhdl.c:vhdl_primname()"
     to generate the weak names if the node is flagged.  Added GUI to set
     "weak" flags.

BUG: VHDL keywords used as signal names get "NV" added to them and cannot
     be crossprobed.
FIX: In "simwindow.c:sim_window_findtrace()", try adding "NV" if basic name
     search fails.  Also, in "network.c:net_parsenetwork()", try removing
     "NV" when searching for name.

BUG: Port name "bit" causes keyword conflict when translated to VHDL for
     simulation.
FIX: In "vhdl.c:vhdl_addstring()", check for "bit" and add "NV".

BUG: Grids change size when library with different lambda value is read in.
FIX: In "io.c:io_unifylambdavalues()" must call "us_adjustlambda()" when
     current library is adjusted.

BUG: 3D view of well contacts shows active layer too high.
FIX: In "tecmocmossub.c:mocmossub_3dheight_layers[]", set P-active-well to 13.

BUG: Copying selected object images to clipboard doesn't include text.
FIX: Defined "usrdisp.c:us_getnodebounds()" and "us_getarcbounds()" to get
     node/arc extent including text.  Use it in "usrhigh.c:us_getareabounds()".

IMP: Added Bus wire and pin to Analog Schematics menu.

IMP: Changed Analog schematic components so that their highlight fits tightly:
     Power, Ground, Resistor, Capacitor.

BUG: Stacked via errors are not detected.
FIX: In "drcbatch.c:drcb_checkdist()" must check spacing, even if the layers
     touch are are electrically connected (don't just check minimum size).

IMP: ERC now gives more information on spacing errors.

BUG: Crashes if library with premature EOF is read.
FIX: In "io.c:io_request()", only call "io_unifylambdavalues" if "l == 0".

BUG: Crashes at exit.
FIX: In "tecmocmossub.c:mocmossub_setstate()" must allocate the
     "techdescript" string.

BUG: Cannot select simulation signals when waveform window is gone.
FIX: In "simalsgraph.c:simals_charhandlerschem()", use result of
     "sim_window_findtrace()" instead of currently highlighted.

BUG: Crash during startup.
FIX: In "usrparse.c:us_addusercom()", must reverse order of calls to
     "us_parsecommand()" and "us_fillcomcomp()".

IMP: Extended "Spread" so that it remembers previous dialog settings and
     can handle multiple nodes.

IMP: Generalized the MOSIS CMOS PLA generator to be able to handle the
     "mocmossub" technology.  Added cell library for it.

IMP: Setting the signal name "[1]" (missing bus name) no longer changes the
     name to match the presumed bus.  Also doesn't issue warning.

BUG: After doing outline editing, the shift-select button doesn't work right.
FIX: In "evemenus.mac:pmepolx", set %A to "find port extra-info more interactive".

IMP: Renamed well/substrate contacts in "mocmossub" to be more sensible.
     Now, "Metal-1-Substrate-Con" is "Metal-1-N-Well-Con" and
     "Metal-1-Well-Con" is "Metal-1-P-Well-Con"

IMP: Now have "bold" lines in Artwork technology.  Renamed the
     "Opened-FarDotted-Polygon" primitive to "Opened-Thicker-Polygon".
     Also changed line texture 3 (OPENEDT3) from "far dotted" to "thicker".

IMP: Modified schematic transistors so that their size is placed properly
     (doesn't obscure output port).

IMP: SKILL output faster: no longer merges contact cuts.

IMP: Added ability to change the size of text in the facet explorer window.

BUG: Full-views of facets with text may not be correct.
FIX: In "usrdisp.c:us_fullview()", must set "nodexfvalid=0" inside the "ni" loop.

BUG: Changing an export (deleting, creating, or renaming) on facets whose
     instances are in another library doesn't mark that other library as
     changed.
FIX: In "conlay.c", filled in the routines "cla_layconnewobject()",
     "cla_layconkillobject()", and "cla_layconnewvariable()" to detect
     these changes and update instances.

IMP: Now have MOSIS CMOS technology option to disallow stacked vias.

BUG: DRC doesn't handle well notch detection right because it doesn't know
     when well is connected (so it uses unconnected rule).
FIX: Created "drcbatch.c:drcb_adjustedmindist()", to presume that implants
     are always connected. 

BUG: DRC doesn't catch Select-to-Select layer errors and minimum with Select.
FIX: In "tecmocmossub.c:mocmossub_connectedtable[]" added entries of "B" for
     LSELECT-to-LSELECT.

IMP: Simulator now remembers signal order.

IMP: Simulator now detects deletion / modification of VHDL and netlist facets
     and stops simulation.  Added "sim_modifyvariable", "sim_insertvariable",
     and "sim_deletevariable" to "sim.c".

BUG: When going "down hierarchy" in the simulation, may not display any signals.
FIX: In "simalscom.c:simals_level_command()", add the line:
		sim_window_settopline(0);
     before the last line which calls "simals_initialize_simulator()".

IMP: Invalid keystrokes are now described correctly ("Ctrl-s" instead of "M-s").

BUG: In multi-window UNIX, allows drag-and-drop.
FIX: In "graphunixx11.c:initgraphics()", disable drag-and-drop in both
     windows if they exist.

BUG: Mirroring doesn't always work.
FIX: Because mirroring uses "temp1" on node instances, and this is also used
     in verbose highlighting, mirroring fails.  Verbose highlighting now uses
     the HIGHLIGHTNVER bit in "userbits" for nodes and HIGHLIGHTAVER for arcs.

BUG: Saving a library reports a number of facets saved that is more than what is
     in the current library (includes all facets in sublibraries).
FIX: In "iobinaryo.c:io_writebinlibrary()" must keep a count of facets in the
     current library and report that.

BUG: UNIX startup may crash while finding ".cadrc".
FIX: In "graphunixx11.c:setupenvironment()", (line 1926), add "len = strlen(pt);"
     before the line "pt[len-6] = 0;" (there are two of these, one is missing).

IMP: NCC now checks export names (if name associations are requested) to make
     sure they are on the same net.

BUG: If "Check port order" is used in NCC, MOS transistors fail to compare.
FIX: Modified "netflat.c:net_buildpseudo()", "netdiff.c:net_allalike()", and
     "netdiff.c:net_diffwirelist()" so that port order is only applied to
     facet instances.

BUG: May think an unused empty library is changed and prompt to save it.
FIX: In "dblibrary.c:changelambda()", only set LIBCHANGEDMAJOR if the library
     has facets.

BUG: Windows "Print" command doesn't handle "rotation" switch.
FIX: In "graphpccode.cpp:gra_printwindow()", use rotation to set print default.

BUG: Polygon merging still fails.
FIX: When inserting holes into merged polygon, must consider all holes and
     add them in the order of proximity to the main polygon.
     When looking for holes, do not consider points that are at the same
     location of others that have been seen.

BUG: Metal-5/6 contact has wrong number of cuts when it is 10x10.
FIX: In "tecmocmossub.c:mocmossub_m5m6[]", change "f3" from K1 to K2.

IMP: Simulator now resimulates to match the waveform window scale.
     Modified "simwindow.c" and "sim.c" to resimulate rather than redisplay.

BUG: "Cut" and "Erase" commands function differently.
FIX: Unified code, created "usrnet.c:us_eraseobjectsinlist()".

BUG: On Windows, the "Copy" command includes highlighting.
FIX: In "graphpccode.cpp:gra_copyhighlightedtoclipboard()", strip off HIGHLIT bit.

IMP: Changes to port characteristics are now reflected between icon and
     contents (modified "dbnoproto.c:changeallports()").  Also check for this
     in "Check and Repair".

IMP: Facet display now includes very large port text (modified
     "usrdisp.c:us_fullview()" and "iopsout.c:io_pswritefacet()").

IMP: CIF output resolution checking now has the option to find but not show.

BUG: If export is re-exported but not wired, CIF output ignores it.
FIX: In "iocifout.c:io_cifwritefacet()", when writing ports (at end)
     check all hierarchical levels of port, not just top.

IMP: If deleting too much circuitry, now turns off network maintainer during
     deletion and turns it back on after deletion.

BUG: When saving a library, library name may become corrupt.
FIX: In "iobinaryo.c:io_writebinlibrary()", save file name in allocated space.

BUG: If a library has its own DRC rules, they overwrite existing rules but
     do not update cache, so rules become garbage.
FIX: Extended "registertechnologycache()" to take variable keys, and added
     new routine: "changedtechnologyvariable()" to test for cached variable keys
     on technologies and update them.  Use this in "iobinaryi.c", "iotext.c",
     and "drc.c".

IMP: Removed obsolete "mocmos2" technology.

IMP: Changed the relative text sizes TXTSMALL, TXTMEDIUM, and TXTLARGE to a wider
     range that is pegged to lambda size: TXTHL, TXT1L, TXT2L, TXT3L, TXT4L, TXT5L,
     and TXT6L.  Modified "io.c:io_fixnewlib()" to adjust sizes in existing
     libraries.  Modified "dbtext.c:truefontsize()" to compute font real sizes.
     Change all code that uses former sizes (small became 1L, medium 2L, large 4L).
     Changed TXTEDITOR and TXTMENU defines to be negative, removed TXTSTATUS.
     Modified all "screensettextsize()" routines to use real sizes.
     Changed "screensettextsize()" and "truefontsize()" to use INTBIG.

IMP: UNIX installation now creates the "bindir":
		$(INSTALL) -d -m755 @bindir@ $(prefix)/lib/electric

************************* Version 6.02.1: Released *************************

BUG: Cannot connect a node to an arc.
FIX: In "usrcomcd.c:us_create()", the code:
		if (toport == NOPORTPROTO)
		{
			us_abortcommand(_("Cannot connect to %s: it has no ports"),
				geomname(togeom));
			return;
		}
     must go after the call to "us_getnodeonarcinst()".

BUG: "cut" of node with connected arcs fails:
FIX: In "usrnet.c:us_cutobjects()", change the lines:
		while(ni->firstportexpinst != NOPORTEXPINST)
			killportproto(np, ni->firstportexpinst->exportproto);
		startobjectchange((INTBIG)geom->entryaddr.ni, VNODEINST);
		killnodeinst(ni);
     to:
		us_erasenodeinst(ni);

************************* Version 6.02: Released November 29, 2000 *************************

BUG: Crashes if attempt is made to wire to a node with no ports.

     and in "dblibrary.c:db_scalenodeinst()", always adjust node bounds, even
     if facet instance did not change size.

BUG: Cannot skeletonize facets that aren't in the current library.
FIX: In "usrcomcd.c:us_copyfacet()", change the line "tolib = el_curlib" to be
     "tolib = fromlib" and remove the code that tests to be sure that
     "fromlib == tolib".

BUG: Changing the text in a nonlayout-text get-info dialog fails.
FIX: In "usrdiacom.c:us_getinfotext()", removed the "#if 0" around the call
     to "setind()".

IMP: "Change" now has the option to ignore port names in matches.  Added
     "ignore-port-names" option to "replace" command, added "ignoreportnames"
     parameter to "replacenodeinst()".

IMP: UNIX now looks for ".cadrc" in standard places to better ensure startup.

IMP: Modified "usrnet.c:us_makeiconfacet()" so that icons align with grid
     boundaries.

BUG: NCC may find errors but still report that the facets are equivalent.
FIX: In "netdiff.c:net_ncconelevel()", must increment "found" when calling
     "net_reportunusedpnet()".

IMP: Now copy Facet Center node when skeletonizing facets.

BUG: When replacing facets with facet centers, alignment is not done right.
FIX: In "dbnoproto.c:replacenodeinst()", if both facets have facet centers,
     must use proper starting value of "lx/hx/ly/hy":
		lx = ni->lowx;   hx = lx + np->highx - np->lowx;
		ly = ni->lowy;   hy = ly + np->highy - np->lowy;

BUG: Polygon merging may miss holes if they are all intersection points.
FIX: In "dbmerge.c:db_mergepoly()", remove the lines:

     displayable node variables.

BUG: Boxed text doesn't make sense for ports.
FIX: Removed ability to set port text to "boxed".

BUG: EDIF output doesn't generate proper names for logic gates.
FIX: In "ioedifo.c:io_edifwritefacet()", the "sprintf" call with the format "%s%d"
     needs an extra parameter at the end: "i".

BUG: When a signal name gets mangled by VHDL generator (i.e. "Z[2]" becomes "Z_2_")
     it cannot be found in the schematic when clicked in waveform.
FIX: In "network.c:net_parsenetwork()", must handle this case.

BUG: Highlighting of signal names in waveform window is too high.
FIX: In "simwindow.c:sim_window_drawtracedrag()" and "sim_window_highlighttrace()"
     shift Y value up by 2.

FIX: In "dbmath.c:corneroffset()", must accout for proper primitive size.

IMP: When N and P are switched, display is redrawn.

IMP: Modified dialogs so that they make no change if "OK" is clicked but nothing
     was actually changed.

IMP: Cast-of-thousands list now tells what each person did (when you click on their name).

BUG: Compaction causes DRC errors.
FIX: In "compact.c:com_minseparate()", polygons are connected only if
		"pindex == nindex && pindex != -1"
     Also, use special DRC rule to ignore spacing when layers are the same
     and involve contacts or substrate.

IMP: Now shows unassociated networks in NCC.

IMP: Changed Analog Schematic components to set default values on creation
     rather than prompting for new values.

BUG: Unable to "redo" more than one level.
FIX: In "dberror.c:termerrorlogging()", must only set "aid:user.USER_local_capv"
     if the new value is different.

BUG: "See Manual" fails silently on Windows.
FIX: In "graphpccode.cpp:browsefile()", test return code of "ShellExecute()".

IMP: Changed constants "FILETYPETEXT" to variables "el_filetypetext" so that tables
     and constants don't have to align.  Also changed all filetype parameters to be
     INTBIG in "multifileselectin()", "describefiletype()", "getfiletype()" "xopen()",
     "xcreate()", "fileselect()"

IMP: Added special dialog for "new pure layer node" and detection when there are none.

IMP: When there are no ports, "show exported ports" says so.

BUG: When ignoring power and ground in NCC, may produce incorrect number of nets.
FIX: In "netflat.c:net_makepseudo()", must create a PNET for every network, just
     ignore if it necessary.  Also in "netflat.c:net_buildpseudo()", must do the same.

FIX: In "simspice.c:sim_spicewritefacet()", must assign nonzero values to "pp->temp1"
     after including model cards.

BUG: After creating a new technology (with the technology editor), crash may
     result if universal pins are used.
FIX: In "tecgen.c:gen_makeunivlist()", must not leave zero entry at start
     after the first run of the routine.  Also must store results in real
     node prototype after the first run.

IMP: Converting to layout now gives better error messages, shows result.

BUG: "Annular Ring" command cannot work in Schematics technology, but tries to
     anyway.

BUG: Cancelling the "Change" dialog crashes on Macintosh and UNIX/Athena.
FIX: Modified "usrdiacom.c:us_replacedlog()" to do the "us_replace()" call.
     Also, in "graphmac.c/graphunixx11.c:DiaDoneDialog()" popup case, only
     free "namelist" if "count" is positive.

BUG: Cannot simulate a facet that is not in the current library.
FIX: In "vhdl.c:vhdl_startoutput()" change "el_curlib" to "np->cell->lib".

BUG: VHDL generation may break comment lines onto two lines.
FIX: In "vhdl.c" define new function "vhdl_printoneline()" which never splits
     the line and then use it for all comments.

IMP: Made POLYGON a first class object (created VPOLYGON and added firstvar/numvar
     to the structure.

BUG: When hierarchical DRC finds an error between objects in separate subfacets,
     it displays both subfacets.
FIX: In "dberror.c:reportcurrenterror()", do not force display of Geom's facet
     if the geom is not to be shown.

BUG: Silicon compiler crashes if power and ground routing cannot be done.
FIX: In "sc1route.c:Sc_route_create_power_ties()", change the lines:
		for (num = 1; num < chan->number; num++)
			row = row->next;
     to be:
		for (num = 1; num < chan->number && row != 0; num++)
			row = row->next;
		if (row == 0) return(SC_NOERROR);
     In "sc1route.c:Sc_route_create_ground_ties()", change the lines:
		for (num = 0; num < chan->number; num++)
			row = row->next;
     to be:
		for (num = 0; num < chan->number && row != 0; num++)
			row = row->next;
		if (row == 0) return(SC_NOERROR);

FIX: In "simspice.c:sim_spicewritefacet()", check for icon view and use contents
     before recursing.

BUG: You can place an icon into the layout of the same cell, causing recursion
     and a crash.
FIX: In "dbmath.c:isachildof()", test "child->cell == parent->cell" rather than
     "child == parent".

IMP: The "Get Info" dialog on text objects shows the actual position of the text.

IMP: In the VIEW commands "Edit Layout View", "Edit Schematic View", etc., if the
     window is already on the display, it is brought to the front, rather than
     creating a new one.  Created the routine "us_bringwindowtofront()" in the
     GRAPH modules and added the command "editfacet FACET non-redundant".

BUG: On UNIX, deleting one of the two simulation windows causes simulation
     to stop.
FIX: In "usrmisc.c:us_killcurrentwindow()", must reinstate the simulation
     bit in the new window after the call to "us_windowfit".
     In "simwindow.c:sim_window_termschemhandler()" and
	 "simwindow.c:sim_window_termhandler()", must not call "sim_window_stopsimulation"
     but just reset the "sim_window_np" variable so that it can be put back
     in "sim_window_redisphandler" and the newly created "sim_window_redispschemhandler".

BUG: SPICE options are not saved with the library.
FIX: In "sim.c:sim_init()", "sim.c:sim_set()", and "usrdiacom1.c:tty_simdlog()"
     removed the VDONTSAVE from sets of "sim_spice_state" and "sim_spice_level".

BUG: When converting small-lambda technologies (such as mocmossub) to schematics,
     components are large and overlapping.
FIX: In "usrctech.c:us_tran_logmakenodes()", must scale placement of components.

IMP: Binary I/O is now 64-bit clean.  New library format saves big and
     and small integer size.  Changed "iobinaryi.c" and "iobinaryo.c".

IMP: When duplicating nodes or arcs, names on them are forced to be
     unique.  Created "usrnet.c:us_copyvars()" and call it from
     "usrcomcd.c:us_duplicate()".

BUG: If a "Save As" is cancelled, subsequent "Save" commands still
     prompt for a file name.
FIX: Changed macros for "Save As" and also removed statements that
     set "el_pleasestop" in "dbtext.c:xcreate(),
     "graphunixx11.c:gra_fileselect()", and
     "usrparse.c:tty_specialparse()".

IMP: Renamed ports on some schematic components to be more sensible.
     "Source" now has ports "plus" and "minus"; "Meter" now has ports
     "a" and "b"; "Two-Port" now has ports "a", "b", "x", and "y".
     This change also requires a fix to "iobinaryi.c:io_doreadlibrary()"
     and "iotext.c:io_getport()" and the addition of
     "io.c:io_convertoldportname()" to properly read old format libraries.

IMP: The "Get Info" dialog now can manipulate the parameters of schematic
     components.

BUG: When changing schematic components to other schematic components,
     old schematic parameters persist and have no meaning.
FIX: When changing these components, old parameters are removed.

BUG: On UNIX, middle button does strange things.
FIX: Modified macro files (lib/egnumenus.mac) to unprogram this button.

BUG: Behaves badly or crashes during technology editing, when changing
     characteristics of a port.  On Windows, typing into dialog does not work.
	 On all systems, moving port after a change may crash.
FIX: For Windows dialog bug, "graphpccode.cpp:gra_keyaction()", must offset
     the coordinates by the window corner position.  For port motion crash,
     "usredtecc.c:us_teceditmodobject()" must handle PORTOBJ case specially and
     reset the currently highlighted node after calling "us_tecedmodport()".

IMP: In the SPICE Options dialog, now allow the use of "Use Node Names"
     checkbox for SPICE3 (used to only allow it in HSPICE).

BUG: On UNIX and Windows Visual C 6.0, crashes when changing port
     characteristics in the technology editor.
FIX: In "usrcom1.c:us_paramsedtecport()", must declare static character
     arrays:
		static char technologycpynpdef[4];
		static char technologycpbpdef[20];
     and then set the "def" fields of "technologycpbp" and "technologycpynp"
     to them before copying to those fields, for example:
		technologycpbp.def = technologycpbpdef;

BUG: When simulating, cannot shift the waveform window left or right.
FIX: In "sim.c:sim_set()", in the "window move" case, in the "left and right"
     subcases, the line:
		if (count < 2) time = size / 2.0; else
     should change the "< 2" to a "< 4".  In the "up and down" case, the line:
		if (count < 2) amount = signals / 2; else
	 should also change the "< 2" to a "< 4".

BUG: When the "mocmossub" technology is converted to a library, it cannot
     be converted back.
FIX: In "usredtecg.c:us_tecedmakelibfromtech()", must set separation
     to a minimum of 5000 units by adding:
		if (xs < 5000) xs = 5000;
		if (ys < 5000) ys = 5000;
     after the line
		ys = (pnp->highy - pnp->lowy) * 2 * tech->deflambda / oldlam;

BUG: On UNIX and Windows Visual C 6.0, crashes when the SPICE Options dialog
     requests heading or trailing model cards from a file.
FIX: In "usrparse.c:tty_specialparse()", must copy the "prompt" parameter to
     a temporary location before modifying it.  Also, in
     "graphunixx11.c:gra_fileselect()", must call "DiaAllowSubDialog()" before
     each call to "DiaInitDialog()".

BUG: On UNIX and Windows Visual C 6.0, crashes when converting technologies
     to libraries.
FIX: In "dbnoproto.c:newnodeproto()", must copy the "fname" parameter to
     a temporary location before modifying it.

BUG: On Windows, cursors dissapear when the background color is black.
FIX: Made cursors use "inverse" color instead of black.

BUG: CIF input fails if there are layers for both n and p processes in the
     same file (and the technology is the MOSIS CMOS switchable one).
FIX: In "tecmocmossub.c", change lines 550 and 551 from empty strings
     ("","",) to the proper layer strings ("CSP","CSN", and "CWP","CWN",).
     Also added "Poly-Cap-Node" and "P-Active-Well-Node" pure-layer nodes.

BUG: Sample PLA personality files mentioned in document are not in distribution.
FIX: Files are now in the distribution.

IMP: Made Electric 64-bit clean.  Changed INTBIG to "long".  Changed %d to %ld
     where appropriate.  Changed "unsigned" to "UINTBIG".

IMP: On UNIX, crashes when X display is not set right.
FIX: Used "printf" instead of "error" in "graphunixx11.c:gra_finddisplay()".

IMP: Improved User's manual HTML: added <HTML> at start of pages; fixed
     places where <HEAD> had missing "<"; added ALT to all images; changed
     "<" and ">" to &lt; and &gt; changed <H3> to <H2>; shortened <TITLE>;
     changed version from 5.4g3 to 5.4g4; and added the missing
     section 9-9.  Also removed all references to company propreitary
     code.

IMP: Modified UNIX Makefile to ignore unused modules "dblangelk.c" and "dblangtcl.c".

IMP: Cleaned up compiler warnings in "graphunixx11.c", "dbmult.c"

************************* Version 5.4g4: Released 11/24/98 *************************

BUG: UNIX does not automatically detect the need for the Xmu library.
FIX: Improved "configure" to detect the presence of this library.

BUG: Some compilers complain about extra semicolon after close bracket
     in header files (happens in the extern "C" wrapper for C++).
FIX: Removed the semicolons.

BUG: On the Mac and UNIX, dialogs with scrollable areas draw the
     vertical scrollbar incorrectly.
FIX: In "usrdialogs.c:Dsetvscroll()", must add 13 to r.right, not 14.
     Also, in the UNIX version of "Dgrayrect()", must not subtract 1
     from right and bottom coordinates.

BUG: If a new library is read while simulating, the red border persists.
FIX: In "usrcomln.c:us_library()", must terminate simulation after reading
     a new library that replaces the current one.

     the mask to "LAYERA" after writing highlighted trace info.

IMP: Fixed the routines "usrdialogs.c:Dgettextsize()" and
     "usrdialogs.c:Ddrawtext()" to copy their argument before modifying
     it so that strings do not need to be writable.  Then removed the
     "-fwritable-strings" flag on UNIX.

BUG: On HP UNIX, "scandir" call fails to compile in "graphunixx11.c".
FIX: Conditional code to define "gra_fileselectall" for HPUX.

BUG: On Windows, under Visual C++ 6.0, program will not run.
FIX: Visual C++ 6.0 places string constants in protected memory.  Fix involves
     changing "dbcontrol.c:el_primaryinit()" to place the constants "noname"
     into temporary arrays (because "newlibrary()" may modify its arguments);
     and modifying "dbtext.c:getnodeproto()" and "dbtext.c:getarcproto()" to
     copy their argument before modifying them (because they may be passed
     constants).

BUG: On Windows, compiled version of Electric requires Msvcrtd.dll and
     Mfc42d.dll to run (these DLLs are available only on machines with
     Visual C installed).
FIX: Changed "General" setting to be "Use MFC in a Static Library".

BUG: If "cadrc" file is missing, system may crash.
FIX: In "dbtext.c:xopen()", must test for "otherdir == 0" as well as
     "*otherdir == 0".

IMP: Added introductory display during loading (added to "usr.c:us_do2init()").

IMP: Corrected warning messages produced on BSD (requested brackets, implicit
     declarations).

IMP: Now check for "mkstemp" and use it (instead of "mktemp") in "iobinaryo.c".

IMP: Now check for "termios.h" (a BSD header file) and use it in "usr.h",
     "graphunixx11.c", and "simsim.c".

IMP: Documentation now indicates that UNIX users must use GNU make.
     Documentation now points users to www.gzip.org for more information.
     Documentation now makes even more clear that UNIX users must use 8 bit
     display (and that Windows users must use 16 or more).

BUG: On PC, numeric keypad doesn't work for window-shifting commands
     (such as Control-4 to shift left).
FIX: In "graphpcchildframe.cpp", added code to the "OnKeyDown" method
     to recognize the numeric keypad.

BUG: On UNIX, the define "HAVE_SGTTY_H" was not set properly.
FIX: Added "#undef HAVE_SGTTY_H" to "defines.h.in"

BUG: Some compilers use "restrict" as a keyword, causing compilation
     errors.
FIX: In "global.h" and "dbvars.c", changed parameter "restrict" in
     the routine "initobjlist()".

IMP: On UNIX, cleaned up "Makefile.in" for better installation.  Also
     removed "termcap" library.

IMP: Upgraded Macintosh code for CodeWarrior release 22 (from
     Mariusz Niewczas of CMU). Involved changes to "config.h",
     "usr.c", "usrcomtv.c", "dbmult.c", "graphmac.c" and "graphmacsys.c"

************************* Version 5.4g3: Released 10/9/98 *************************

IMP: UNIX file selection now using extension filters (for example,
     readable dump files must end in ".txt").

IMP: Made SPICE simulation *NOT* simulate automatically on any platform.

BUG: On UNIX, creation of output files fails.
FIX: In "graphunixx11.c:gra_fileselect()", output case must call
     DiaGetText(4) before calling DiaDoneDialog().

IMP: Added hooks to enable ELK LISP to be compiled on UNIX.

BUG: Simulation window does not show selected nets when window uses
     white-background color map.
FIX: In "simwindow.c:sim_window_writetracename()", use highlight color
     for trace name, not WHITE; in "sim_window_drawcursors()", make
     initial call to "sim_window_drawbox()" use 114 as first parameter,
     not zero.

BUG: On the PC, cannot plot spice listings.
FIX: Remove exclusion code at start of "simspicerun.c:sim_spice_execute()"

BUG: On the PC, the Messages Window Font command of the Windows menu fails.
FIX: Added code for font selection in "graphpccode.cpp:gra_setfont()".

BUG: Popup menus don't work on PC (this is noticed when trying to
     edit technologies).
FIX: In "graphpccode.cpp", must do "p2.x = p2.y = 0;" before
     calling MapWindowPoints.

IMP: Combined machine-specific terminal-handlers (graphmacterminal.c,
     graphpcterminal.c, and graphunixterminal.c) into one uniform file:
     terminal.c

BUG: Ports "1" and "2" on the schematic flipflop are syntically bad
     in VHDL.
FIX: Renamed them to "i1" and "i2".

IMP: Added X Windows toolkit for UNIX port.  Makes messages window
     scroll and not need "-MORE-" stuff.  Got rid of all "-More-"
     handling code in the system (it was only used on UNIX).

IMP: Added cut and paste on UNIX.

************************* Version 5.4g2: Released 9/17/98 *************************

IMP: Added copying notification to book and manual.

BUG: UNIX Messages window cannot rescale, main window shrinks when redrawn
FIX: Redid "graphunixx11.c" and "graphunixterminal.c"

IMP: Removed LINUX exception to use of FLOATSCALE in dbmath.c

IMP: Added "system print" command to Windows and implemented real printing.

************************* Version 5.4g1: Completed 9/10/98, sent to GNU *************************

BUG: Jogging arc (as a result of overconstraint) is not undoable
FIX: In "conlay.c:cla_domovearcinst()", changed "db_retractarcinst()"
     call to "db_killarcinst()".

BUG: moving exported pin doesn't always propagate hierarchically
FIX: In "dbchange.c:db_forcehierarchicalanalysis()", must create a change
     facet if it isn't in the list.  Added these lines at the end:
		db_setchangefacet(np);
		db_forcehierarchicalanalysis(np);

IMP: Made last parameter to "trackcursor" be constant defines.

BUG: UNIX fonts don't work on LINUX
FIX: New font names

BUG: UNIX box inversion fails because of copy-to-self ordering
FIX: Use "fillrectangle" instead.

IMP: Switched UNIX building to use "autoconf"

IMP: Moved these routines out of "dbtext.c": filesindirectory,
     db_machinetimeoffset, filedate, starttimer, endtimer, gotosleep, truepath,
     fileexistence, createdirectory, currentdirectory, lockfile, unlockfile

IMP: Made schematic primitives scalable: Resistor, Diode, Capacitor,
     Mux, and Buffer

IMP: Added third parameter to "truefontsize" to get ports to display right

BUG: Compaction did not work right
FIX: Fixed overflow problem in line sorting.

BUG: Point-and-click text edit crashes when lines are deleted
FIX: In "usreditpac.c:us_editpacremoveselection()", must ensure that
     copied lines have enough characters when shifting them.
	 Also, in "us_editpacimplementchar()", when adding a line (i == '\n')
	 must compare "linecount", not "curline" when deciding to add more lines.

IMP: Better display of network consistency results.

IMP: Better scanning for "cadrc" files.

BUG: Generation of VHDL produces names with illegal characters.  Also, ALS
     netlist generation and ALS simulator do not accomodate illegal characters.
FIX: In "vhdl.c:vhdl_generatevhdl()", call "vhdl_addstring()" more often.
     In "vhdlals.c:vhdl_genals_interface()" and
	 "simalsflat.c:simals_find_model()", convert nonalpha characters properly.

BUG: When creating a node from the component menu, name of node isn't in status area.
FIX: In "usrcomcd.c:us_create()", call "us_setnodeproto()" after calls to
     "us_clearhighlightcount()".

BUG: Arc curvature fails for large numbers.
FIX: Rewrote "dbmath.c:findcenters()" in floating point.

BUG: Renaming library doesn't preserve ".elib", prints wrong message
FIX: In "us_rename()", preserve .elib.  In "iobinaryo.c", use new name.

IMP: Replaced ELK 1.5 with ELK 3.0

IMP: Improved matching algorithm for converting from one layout technology to
     another.  Improved "usrctech.c:us_figurenewnproto()"

BUG: Moving an arc forces node to move even if it is slidable
FIX: Proper setting of temporary rigidity in "us_manymove()"

IMP: Added interlock so that multiple dialogs cannot be displayed at once.

IMP: Added new layers: LFCONTACT4 and APPOLY3

BUG: Color palette all wrong.
FIX: Must preserve layer names, must use proper layer defines to construct
     layer letter combinations, must scale window when redrawn

IMP: Moved "DRAWTINYFACETS" from WINDOW->state to us_aid->aidstate

IMP: Simulator now detects arc negation as a termination condition.
     Filled in "sim.c:sim_new/killvariable()".

BUG: "arc toggle-negated/directional/ends-extend/skip-head/skip-tail" fails.
FIX: Must fix "usrnet.c:us_modarcbits()" to not use form "X = X &= Y"

BUG: Directional arcs have no arrowhead.
FIX: In "dbtechi.c", must scale constants (K1) by lambda before using them.

FIX: Switch to real layers when pins are exported.

IMP: Split Auto-stitching out into its own module: routauto.c

BUG: Mimic stitching misses some arcs
FIX: In "routmimic.c:ro_mimicstitch()", include possible offset between sample arc ends and port centers.

IMP: Added SCFIXEDWIDTH to "DiaInitTextDialog()" to force fixed-width text

BUG: Artwork color dialog set wrong colors.
FIX: Fixed table in "usrdiacom1.c:tty_artlookdlog()"

IMP: "size corner-fixed" allows interactive selection of the fixed corner.

IMP: Cleaned up all code for GNU release, removing old commented-out stuff.

BUG: PC windows have wrong facet name

IMP: Changed "Read External Library" and "Write External Library" to "Import" and "Export"

************************* Version 5.4b3: Completed 6/23/98, sent to Interval *************************

IMP: Removed EDIF output from GNU release

************************* Version 5.4b2: Completed 6/12/98 sent to DAC *************************

IMP: Added dialog fields to directly specify POPUP, PROGRESS, and USERDRAWN.
 
IMP: PC interface cleaned up

************************* Version 5.4b1: Completed 6/9/98 sent to Interval *************************

IMP: Packaged GNU release

BUG: Drawing wires jogs pins improperly in MOSIS CMOS.
FIX: In "usrcomcd.c:us_create()", modified pin placement so that it is near cursor only
     if port polygon is irregular.

IMP: Added variable aid:user.USER_application to determine which config was built and load
     appropriate macro files.

IMP: Modified dialog system so that POPUP, USERDRAWN, and PROGRESS are directly specified in dialog tables.

IMP: Modified "usr.c" so that characters could be typed when there is no current window.

IMP: Modified simulation system so that ALS could be removed and still have Window facility.

IMP: Modified compensation tables in "compensate.c" to be generic (not Hutch-specific)

IMP: Rewrote PC interface for MFC.

BUG: The up arrow key doesn't work in the point-and-click editor.
FIX: Improved code in "usreditpac.c"

BUG: Domain error when computing distance to line that has no length.
FIX: In "dbmath.c:db_disttoline()", check for null line and compute simpler distance.

IMP: Made SPICE default write parasitics.

************************* Version 5.3f: Completed 12/31/97 *************************

BUG: If there is no current nodeproto, "create" may crash.
FIX: In "usrcomcd.c:us_create()", test for us_curnodeproto being null.

BUG: When generating VHDL, if first port on a component is not connected, "open" is not generated.
FIX: In "vhdl.c:vhdl_addrealports()", separated end case so that comma generation is not the same
     as writing "open".

************************* Version 5.3b23: Completed 12/12/97, sent to Hutchinson Tech. *************************

BUG: DXF input fails for bulge values that are greater than 1 (more than 180 degrees of bulge)
FIX: In "iodxf.c:io_dxfreadentities()", inverted sense of center picking when bulge is large.

IMP: Changed "usrhigh.c:us_makecurrentobject()" so that it sets NONODEPROTO in the current nodeproto
     if no node is selected.

IMP: Changed status information drawing so that it is directly tied to the notion of a status bar
     rather than a status area at the top of messages (later has now gone away).  Thus, the routines
     that control the header of the messages window are gone and now there are the routines:
     "ttydeclarestatusfield", "ttyfreestatusfield", "ttynumstatuslines", and "ttysetstatusfield".

IMP: Changed simulation so that it is invoked with "tellaid simulation simulate FORMAT" rather
     than using "onaid".

IMP: Added "tellaid network show-equivalent" to show the current network in other facets, but not
     the in the current one.

IMP: When a network is selected during simulation, it automatically shows the equivalent in other
     windows.

IMP: Draw red border around simulating windows.

BUG: Can place components in waveform windows.
FIX: Check in "usrcomcd.c:us_create()".

IMP: Added ability to drag signal names to rearrange their position in waveform window.

IMP: Improved response to "add feature" in ELM.

IMP: Changed "xopen" to take a "filetype" argument that identifies the desired file.

************************* Version 5.3b22: Completed 11/7/97, sent to Hutchinson Tech. *************************

IMP: Changed line creation ("tellaid compensation connect-points") to pick up DXF and GDS layers.

BUG: "debug check" does not compute bounds properly when there is a facet center.
FIX: Changed "usrcheck.c:us_checklibrary()" to handle facet center computation properly.

BUG: When nodes and arcs are duplicated and their variables are copied, bounds are wrong.
FIX: In "dbvars.c:copyvars()", recompute bounds after copying variables.

BUG: Facet bounds are incorrect if there is only a facet center.
FIX: In "dbgeom.c:db_boundfacet()" compute properly.

BUG: Nodes with trace information that are transformed have incorrect bounds computation.
FIX: In "dbgeom.c:boundobj()", use transformation when computing bounds.

BUG: If the user makes an array with too large a spacing or too many objects, overflow will occur.
FIX: In "usrcomab.c:us_array()", check for overflow.

IMP: Changed VHDL generation so that it places the full hierarchy into a single VHDL facet
     (rather than creating separate facets for each level).  This also causes the VHDL compiler
     to generate a single netlist facet.  It allows proper combination of subfacets without
     duplication and makes libraries smaller.

BUG: Contour detection sometimes creates contours for small objects.
FIX: In "dbcontour.c:gathercontours()", prevent single-object contours and ensure that the threshold
     for closed contours is equal to the largest threshold used to detect them.

BUG: Circle arcs that are transposed are not handled properly.
FIX: Created the routine "dbtech.c:getarcendpoints()" which handles transposition right.

BUG: Nodes with polygonal trace capability but no trace have bounds computed wrong.
FIX: In "dbgeom.c:boundobj()", detected lack of trace data.

IMP: Changed menu specification so that ">entry<" is checked, "entry<" is unchecked, and "entry"
     cannot have checkbox.  This is for TCL menus which can draw unchecked checkboxes.

BUG: Compensation keeps contour lists on facets, but this information fails to undo properly.
FIX: Now keeps contour lists in private data structures.

BUG: Undoing moved text leaves bad highlight.
FIX: In "usrtrack.c", clear highlighting before setting new highlight when mouse goes up.

IMP: Added "library read FILENAME merge LIBRARYNAME" to allow SDF files to merge with existing
     libraries.

IMP: Added feature to ALS netlist generation to find Actel tables and generate gate models

IMP: Added "iosdf.c" to handle SDF input.

BUG: PostScript output bad (boxes drawn with only 3 lines)
FIX: Fixed "iopsout.c"

IMP: Removed obsolete simulators: Mars, Generic, Salt, and Cadat
     Removed obsolete input module: Applicon/860

BUG: When doing "save as" on UNIX, old file is deleted
FIX: Have "rename/delete" in "iobinaryo.c" be ignored if library did not come from disk.

IMP: Added centralized facility for back-annotation of nodes in "network.c".
     Call it from VHDL generation, EDIF and L output, and these simulator deck generators:
	cadat, generic, mossim, silos, spice, verilog

BUG: When undoing window frame creation, window frame doesn't go away.
FIX: Added "framelx", "framehx", "framely", "framehy" in WINDOW field.
     Added "HASOWNFRAME" bit in "WINDOW->state".
     Changed "newpwindow" to "newewindow" with argument for creating frame.

BUG: Cancelling a "save as" or any other file creation command (I/O, simulation decks, etc.)
     generates an error.
FIX: In "dbtext.c:xcreate()", return zero in last parameter to indicate abort, and must handle
     this condition in all code that uses the routine.

IMP: Fixed change control so that undo steps backwards and redo steps forwards.
     Changed "undolastbatch" to be "undoabatch" and added "redoabatch".
     Changed "flushchanges" to "noundoallowed", and added "noredoallowed"
     Added "undonature" to describe next batch without undoing/redoing it
     Removed "quietlysetvalkey" and "quietlydelvalkey" and added "nextvarchangequiet" to make
     the next variable change call be done quietly.
     Removed "describechange" and moved dialog code from "usrdiacom2.c" into "dbchange.c".

BUG: Simulation window doesn't clip properly.
FIX: In "simwindow.c:sim_window_savegraph()" and "simwindow.c:sim_window_drawgraph()", check
     for digital waveforms that are too high and stop displaying.

************************* Version 5.3b21: Completed 10/17/97, sent to Hutchinson Tech. *************************

BUG: Crashes when simulation waveform window is saved.
FIX: In "simwindow.c:sim_window_savegraph()", must compute widest data on all tracks.

BUG: Geometry size is computed badly for arcs.

     where "s" option staggers array.

IMP: "create to" with no parameters defaults to the current snap point, if any.

BUG: Some nodes with special geometry affect the bounding box of the facet incorrectly.
     Specifically, circle nodes with arc information have the complete circle included
     in the bounding box; schematic wire pins have the full steiner point included;
     serpentine MOS transistors do not have the full geometry included.
FIX: In "dbgeom.c:boundobj()", must compute the bounding area of the node properly.
     Also, must know to update geometry appropriately, so "dbtech.c:setarcdegrees()"
     calls "updategeom()".  Also in "dbcreate.c", the routines "db_enterarcinst()" and
     "db_retractarcinst()" update the node ends.

IMP: To be able to handle multiple collections of strings at a time, the routines
     "initlinestofacet()", "addlinetofacet()", "doneaddinglinestofacet()" are now:

     commands.

IMP: Modified "usrmisc.c:us_modifytextdescript()" to ignore null changes.

BUG: Cannot use output of "var" command as input to "find object" because "var" returns strings
     of the form "nodeNNNNN" but "find object" wants "node NNNN".
FIX: Improved "find object" to handle "var" results.

IMP: When negating an arc, prefer the side that is on an output port over the side that is on an
     input port (modified "usrnet.c:us_modarcbits()").

BUG: Moving text on a node is not considered an important change for undo purposes.
FIX: In "dbchange.c:undolastbatch()", added positive "retval" to the DESCRIPTMOD case.

        sets color of digital traces in the simulation waveform window
     "tellaid simulation window (2-state-display | 12-state-display)"
       switches between full (12-state) and on/off (2-state) simulation
     "tellaid simulation window (advance-time | freeze-time)"
       sets whether simulator advances time to end of simulation after each step
     "tellaid simulation window (display-waveform | ignore-waveform)"
       sets whether simulator shows waveform window or not
     Now shows colors in original layout/schematic when simulating digital circuits.
     Also allows simulation commands to be entered in the layout/schematic window.
     Changed cursors from "white" and "black" to be "main" and "extension".

IMP: Added the routines: "getecolor()" and "ecolorname()" to convert between strings and colors.

BUG: River router cannot work with schematic wires
FIX: Use default lambda as basic unit of distance if minimum DRC cannot be found.

IMP: Added "tellaid network rip-bus" command to rip a bus into multiple wires.

BUG: Bus wire names do not propagate properly.
FIX: In "network.c", must propagate bus wires first, then others.

     find_centers => findcenters, arc_bbox => arcbbox, load_code => loadcode

IMP: Changed "INT32" and "INT16" to "INTBIG" and "INTSML" to prevent conflicts with X

IMP: Changed "mymalloc" and "myfree" to "emalloc" and "efree".

BUG: When a library is erased in the same batch that it is created or modified, crash occurs.
FIX: In "usr.c", must fill in "us_eraselibrary" to remove all queued redraws.
     In "drc.c", must fill in "dr_eraselibrary" to remove all queued checks.

BUG: Full redisplay does not include the facet center.
FIX: In "usrdisp.c:us_fullscreen()", must recompute bounds rather than use what is in
     facet, because facet computation ignores facet center.

IMP: Changed escape character from "\" to "^" so that Windows directory separators would work.

BUG: "tellaid compensation uncompensate" or "tellaid compensation draw-pre-compensation"
     shows bad data if it is from an older version of Electric.

FIX: In "usrhigh.c:us_gethighlighted()" and "usrhigh.c:us_getallhighlighted()" added edge-select code.

BUG: TCL standard in/out doesn't appear anywhere
FIX: Added console code to "dblangtcl.c"

IMP: Added variable "IO_gds_layer" on nodes and arcs to override the GDS output
     layer.

BUG: Some dialogs return and display bad values
FIX: Because their strings get deallocated when the dialogs close, they must be
     copied to infinite strings first.  This happens in these dialogs: ALS clock"
     UNIX File output, Gain, Lambda, Technology, Undo multiple, Edit Facet, etc.

IMP: Removed the "find another" command and replaced all usage of it with "find more"
     Created the routine "usrhigh.c:us_gettwoobjects()" and use it for:
	arc creation (usrcomcd.c:us_create())
	port moving (usrcomoq.c:us_port())
	"technology edit change" with two objects selected (wiring) (usredtecc.c:us_teceditmodobject())

     and in "usrdialogs.c:Dstuffmessage()", removed line "msg += dia_it.firstch"

BUG: Terminal input may produce bad results
FIX: In "*terminal.c:ttygetline()", must store results of DiaGetText in an infinite string
     before returning it.

BUG: Point-and-click editor may crash
FIX: In "usreditpac.c:us_editpacbeginwork()", moved the line "e->working = e->curline" from the

IMP: Array dialog now presents proper defaults for centerline spacing option.

BUG: Undo only affects last change of any kind, so is not what the user wants
FIX: Modified "dbchange.c:undolastbatch()" so it tells whether change was major or not
     (major changes involve nodes, arcs, ports, or facets).  Modified "usrcomtv.c:us_undo()"
     to go back to the last major change when the batch count is unspecified.

IMP: Changed bit fields from INT32 to UINT32.  This includes all "userbits" fields, all
     "textdescript" fields, the "initialbits" fields in TECH_ARCS and TECH_PORTS, and
     the "type" field on VARIABLE.

IMP: Reformatted for ANSI-C requirements (extra {} around all static array declarations)
     Also rewrote "usredtecg.c" to generate proper technology code.

IMP: Generalized the DXF/GDS bloating so that it is "output bloating".  What used to be

IMP: Modified "network.c:net_redoprim()", "net_nconnect()", and "net_pconnect()" to allow networks to be
     defined as temporal groupings (i.e. breaking only for flipflops and other memory barriers) rather
     than electrical groupings (i.e. breaking when electrical potential does not pass through node)

IMP: Added the variable "aid:user.USER_machine" to report the machine configuration
     (either "UNIX", "Macintosh", "Windows", or "VAX");

BUG: "dbmath.c:getbbox()" does not handle circle arcs right.
FIX: Added call to "arc_bbox()" in the routine.

BUG: When addressing an array variable with an invalid index, should return empty
FIX: In "dbtext.c:describevariable()", changed array test code to do that

BUG: When selecting black background, black lines are not visible.
FIX: In "usrmisc.c:us_getcolormap()", swap black and white colors when using a black background.

IMP: Removed command line options "-d" (debug tty mode) and "-o" (one screen mode)

BUG: When a library is read in a foreign format, the top facet is not displayed right
FIX: In all input modules (iodxf.c, ioapple.c), add the line:
	(*el_curconstraint->solve)(NONODEPROTO);
     after the design is read

IMP: Generalized library usage so that there is less need for a "current library".
     Improved: dbnoproto.c
     Added "getcurfacet()" to return facet in current window (reducing use of lib->curnodeproto)
     Added "library new LIBNAME" to create a library without switching to it

IMP: Added contour handling code in the database (the module "dbcontour.c").

IMP: Array dialog now allows you to specify centerline distance between elements.

IMP: Added globals in "tecart.h" for all artwork primitives so that they need not be
     fetched by each module that needs them.  Moved global keys into this file.

IMP: Menus with background colors are filled if there is text in the menu
     (fixed "usrmenu.c:us_drawmenuentry()")
     Menus that are all text on the left or right are allowed to be full width
     (fixed "usrmisc.c:us_windowfit()")
     Bind command now allows message text size ("textsize 10p").

BUG: When selection is not right, variable "~o" parses incorrectly
FIX: In "usrparse.c:us_evaluatevariable()", fixed so that "o" option is tested before checking
     validity of selection.

IMP: Added DXF layers to technology: updated technology editor to add DXF field, updated
     "usrcomtz.c" to handle "IO_dxf_layer_names".

IMP: Added "dbtech.c:getarcdegrees()" to retrieve the arc angle and handle floating point
     values, and "dbtech.c:setarcdegrees()" to set these values.

BUG: Rotated nodes may not be displayed.
FIX: In "usrdisp.c:us_drawnodeinst()", changed the clipping code after the comment
     "get outline of nodeinst in the window" to check all four corners of the node,
     not just the low and high corners.

IMP: Added "millimeters" as one of the display units.
     New commands: "technology units TECHNOLOGY millimeter"

BUG: "dbmath.c:intersect()" fails for large values.
FIX: Changed "dbmath.c:intersect()" to use double when values are too large.

IMP: Allow "find" to have two pixels of "slop" in determination of direct hits.
     In "usrnet.c:us_checkoutobject()", added the variable "twopixels" and used it instead
     of the value "0" in direct hit computations.  Also, in "usrnet.c:us_recursivelysearch()"
     made sure that the "slop" variable was at least "twopixels" in size.

BUG: "find" command does not select accurately for irregularly shaped objects (like artwork nodes)
FIX: Added NODEPROTO->userbits bit "NEDGESELECT" which causes nodes to be selected by precise edge
     proximity instead of bounding box.  In "usrnet.c:us_checkoutobject()", "usrnet.c:us_cursoroverhigh()",
     and "usrtrack.c:us_findiup()", changed the simple node code which only uses the node bounds to use
     more precise measures if this bit is set.

BUG: "polydistance" does not work for arcs of circles.
FIX: Added code to "dbmath.c:polydistance()" to handle the CIRCLEARC case.

BUG: "figureangle" fails for large input values.
FIX: Replace the line "limit[90] = div = abs(dy * 10000 / dx);" with:
	for(i=0; i<4; i++)
	    if (labs(dy) < 200000000) dy *= 10; else dx /= 10;
	limit[90] = div = labs(dy / dx);

IMP: Added "compensation" aid (for Hutchinson), also a new entry in key control.

************************* Version 5.2: Completed 8/1/96 *************************

IMP: Added DXF input (for Hutchinson)

IMP: Added "window tiny-facets (draw | hash-out)", and Windows/Tiny Facets Hashed-Out in GUI.

IMP: Added handling of the "quit" apple event to "macinter.c".

BUG: When "Offscreen connector" nodes are used as ports, and the facet is made into an
     icon, the icon has incorrect port characteristics.
FIX: In "usrnet.c:us_makeiconfacet()", change the line:
	port->userbits = pp->userbits | PORTDRAWN;
     to be:
	port->userbits = (port->userbits & ~STATEBITS) | (pp->userbits & STATEBITS) | PORTDRAWN;

IMP: Added the command "show usage FACET" to show where the facet is in use.  Also
     added "List Facet Usage..." command to graphical interface.

IMP: Modified "usrdisp.c:us_drawnodeinst()" to draw facet instances as gray if they
     are expanded but the display scale is too fine.

BUG: Incorrect window management in "graphmac.c".  Fixed much code.

BUG: Incorrect use of the VGRAPHICS case in "dbchange.c:db_namevariable()".
FIX: Use "gra" instead of "win".

BUG: If there is more than 1 security key, the system does not use them.
FIX: Fixed code in "key.c".

IMP: Added the commands "window save VIEWNAME" to save a window view (a zoom/pan) with
     the given name.  Also the command "window name VIEWNAME" restores the named view.

IMP: Added an option to "bind set menu" so that an optional "w" can be added to either
     coordinate to indicate that it is along the width of the menu (the narrower side).

IMP: Added the switch "electric -i macrofile" to read macrofile after startup.

IMP: Added the command "text (easy-text-selection | hard-text-selection)" to make
     text on nodes easy to select (default mode) or hard (only works without the "port"
     option in the "find" command, option-shift on Mac, meta-shift-left on Sun).
     In the graphical interface, changed the WINDOWS/Text Display... entry to be
     WINDOWS/Text Defaults... and added an option to make text selection harder.

BUG: Text facets cannot handle large text windows.
FIX: Modified the "modifyvariable", "insertvariable", and "deletevariable" methods of
     both CONSTRAINT and AIDENTRY to have an INT32 "index".  Edited "usr.h:EDITORTABLE"
     so that the entries "totallines", "getline", "addline", "replaceline",
     "deleteline", "highlightline" use INT32 instead of INT16 (also edited 
     "usreditemacs.c", "usreditpac.c", and "usrmisc.c" to handle this).  Also added a
     "WINDOW->changehandler" option "REPLACEALLTEXT" (and named the other three) so that
     entire text windows can be replaced at once.  Then, in "usrmisc.c:us_doubchanges()",
     removed code that redisplays the text variable when it is deleted and restored.

IMP: Began support for separate windows.  Added "window [new|delete]" commands.
     Added "editfacet FACET [new-window]" option.
     Added a field to the WINDOW structure called "frame".
     Created internal structure in "graphmac.c" called "windowframe" (stored in WINDOW->frame).
     Added these routines in the "graphXXX.c" module: "us_curwindowframe()",
     "us_firstwindowframe()", "us_nextwindowframe()", "us_newwindowframe()",
     "us_getpaletteparameters()", "us_sizewindowframe()", "us_killwindowframe()",
     and "us_settargetframe()".
     Only in "graphmac.c", added the routines "gra_getwindow()" and "gra_getoffscreen()"
     to get fields from the window structure used in the modules: "ioplotmac.c", "macinter.c",
     and "usrdialogs.c".
     In order to replace direct global access to window parameters, wrote "us_getwindowsize()"
     to return what used to be "us_swid" and "us_shei"; and wrote "us_getdispstyle()" to return
     what used to be "us_dispstyle".
     Added a "WINDOW*" argument to these "graphXXX.c" routines: "us_drawline()", "us_drawpolygon()",
     "us_drawbox()", "us_invertbox()", "us_movebox()", "us_savebox()", "us_settextsize()",
     "us_textsize()", "us_puttext()", "us_drawcircle()", "us_drawdisc()", "us_drawcirclearc()",
     "us_drawgrid()".
     Added (x, y) arguments to "us_puttext()", "us_drawcircle()", and "us_drawdisc()".  Removed
     "us_moveto()".
     Created a new window frame "us_menuframe" which has the fixed menu in it.
     Modified code to allow for the case when "el_curwindow" is NOWINDOW.

IMP: Added "dyna" technology.  Requires adding includes of "tecdyna.h" and "rm_defs.h"
     Had to create "tecdyna.h".  Modified "tectable.c" to use include.

************************* Version 5.1a: Completed 1/12/95 *************************

BUG: DRC complains about polysilicon line drawn to right of D-Transistor (mocmos).
FIX: Changed "network.c:getnetonport()" to compare by network, not actual port/arc.
     Specifically, changed the line "if (pi->proto == pp)" to be:
	if (pi->proto->network == pp->network)
     and changed the line "if (pe->proto == pp)" to be:
	if (pe->proto->network == pp->network)
     Also fixed "drc.c:dr_badbox()" so that is sets "net" even if "dr_network()" is not
     called.

IMP: Added Burnie West's routine "getnetonport()" which finds the network associated
     with a port on a node.  Modified "drc.c", "ioedifo.c", "rout.c", "simverilog.c"
     to use it.

IMP: Added a simple "parameterizing" capability by having all hierarchy
     traversers record the traversal path with the database (added the
     routines "begintraversehierarchy", "downhierarchy", "uphierarchy",
     "climbhierarchy", and "descendhierarchy") and then adding a routine
     ("gettraversalpath") to obtain that path during traversal.  Modified
     these modules:
       for DRC traversal: "drcflat.c"
         NOTE: should also convert "drcbatch.c" but this ISN'T DONE YET
       for VHDL conversion: "vhdl.c",
       for general network flattening (PAL, SALT): "netflat.c"
       for general network traversal (display, HPGL, plot, PostScript):
         "usrwindow.c", "usrdisp.c", "usr.c"
     Finally, added the "gettraversalpath" routine to the three language interfaces.

IMP: Moved common routines from "terminal.c" and "macterminal.c" into "usrparse.c".
     Renamed "pa_" and "tty_" variables to be more consistent with use.

BUG: When the user interface is "frozen" and read back in, macros can crash
     during parsing.
FIX: Must clear entry 2 of macros (the parsing structure addresses) because
     they have no meaning when saved and read back in.
     Modified "usrcomcd.c:us_debug()" and "terminal.c".

BUG: The header file "dialogs.h" clashes with a macintosh system include.
FIX: Renamed the file to "edialogs.h".

BUG: Database check thinks it is an error if a port in the contents facet which
     is marked "body only" has no associated icon port.
FIX: Improved checking in "usrcheck.c".

BUG: Cannot print to the Apple Color Printer.
FIX: Added "LockPixels()" and "UnlockPixels()" calls around the "CopyBits" call
     in "ioplotmac.c".

IMP: Added general arrays to the database (new type: VGENERAL which is an array
     of type/address pairs; save and retreive of these in
     "iobinaryi.c:io_readvariables()", "iobinaryo.c:io_writevariables()",
     "iotext.c:io_makestring()", and "iotext.c:io_getvar()"; displaying them in
     "dbtext.c:describevariable()" and "dbtext.c:db_makestringvar()"; examining
     them in "usrparse.c:us_evaluatevariable()"

IMP: Added the command "var vector DEST SOURCE (set|concat|select|pattern|type)
     [SOURCE]" which allows arbitrary arrays to be constructed.  Also added
     "~" options "~nodes", "~arcs", "~ports", "~nets", "~facets", "~libs" to
     get arrays.  Removed obsolete "~" options "~p", "~op", "~e", "~oe".
     Extended "~" to return an array if multiple objects are selected.

IMP: Added the command options "find object TYPE ADDR" and "find clear" so
     that objects can be selected.  Also added "find port comp-interactive"
     so that multiple ports can be selected.

IMP: Added the command option "iterate ARRAY-VARIABLE MACRO" to call MACRO
     with each entry in the ARRAY-VARIABLE.

IMP: Added ability to generate Flip-flops and MUX gates in VHDL generation.

BUG: When a new version is created of a text facet, the status areas do not update
     the information properly.
FIX: Modified "usr.c:us_newobject()" to receive this information and handle it.

BUG: During command completion, typing a SPACE executes the command if it is
     fully specified.
FIX: Changed "terminal.c:pa_getword()" to wait for carriage-return before
     executing command.

BUG: Double-clicking data file does not work on the Macintosh.
FIX: Added High-level Apple Event control to make it work.

IMP: Added the TCL interpreter.  Replaces Prolog.  Now can issue the commands
     "interpret tcl" and "var set ... tcl".  Broke "dblang.c" into submodules:
     "dblang.c", "dblangelk.c", "dblangmm.c", and "dblangtcl.c".

IMP: Added "bind set menu [background COL]..." to assign a color to a fixed menu.
     Added parameter to "usr.c:us_parsebinding()" and, drawing in
     "usrmenu.c:us_drawmenuentry()".

IMP: Added Multiplexor primitive to schematic technology.  Also added "NPMUX"
     node function to "function.h".

IMP: Reorganized the source tree into separate subdirectories.  Also added global
     #define's so that individual aids and technologies can be conditionally compiled

IMP: Added code in "vhdl.c" to generate VHDL for flip-flops.

IMP: Added the commands "window drop-down-menus" and "window pop-up-menus" to control
     menu style on non-Macintosh systems.

IMP: Added X and Y distances to distance tracking information.
     Modified "usrtrack.c:us_distancedown()".

IMP: Added extern "C" wrappers around all prototypes so that C++ can be used.

IMP: Added menu option to see schematic frames in landscape or portrait mode.

IMP: Added new EDIF input and output modules from Glen Lawson.  Includes the
     option to write EDIF schematics or netlists.

IMP: Converted to ANSI standard, with prototypes for all functions.

************************* Version 5.03a: Completed 3/15/94 *************************

BUG: Obvious direct arcs on black box edges are not being created when command-clicking
     away.
FIX: Rewrote "usrarc.c:us_directarcinst()" to test closest possibility.

BUG: Typing multiple characters into a scrollable list does not get the typed
     entry on the sun.
FIX: In "graphx11.c:tickcount()", must divide the "usec" by 100000, not 100.

IMP: Made pulldown menus larger on the sun (special cased the starting point of the
     loop in "usrmenu.c:us_popupmenu()" to be 20 point).

IMP: When creating a port in a facet that has an icon equivalent, a port is created
     in the icon facet.  Initially changed on the single-port export command in
     "usrcomoq.c:us_port()" to call "usrnet.c:us_makenewportproto()".

BUG: Verilog output crashing.
FIX: Changed "free" calls to "myfree" in "simverilog.c".

IMP: Added checking to ensure that icons have the same ports as contents.
     Improved "usrcheck.c:us_checklibrary()".

BUG: When wiring to a multiposition port (the left side of AND, OR, or XOR)
     the new wires have null pins at the end.
FIX: In "usrarc.c:us_directarcinst()", the code that gets better positions when
     ports are specified must use the prefered position (prefx,prefy) in the call
     to "shapeportpoly()" and set the final argument to 1.

IMP: Moving a node with wires connected to stranded pins causes the wires to be
     temporarily rigid.  Added code to the beginning of "usrnet.c:us_manymove()".
     Also added code to "usrtrack.c:us_multidragdraw()".

BUG: AGL input crashes.
FIX: In "ioaglin.c:io_aglreadheader()", change all "io_aglgetnextvalue(dummy)"
     calls to "io_aglgetnextvalue(&dummy)".  Also, in "ioaglin.c:io_readagllibrary()",
     declare "RECT r;" and change the line:
	DiaDrawRect(3, 0);
     to:
	DiaItemRect(3, &r);
	DiaDrawRect(&r, 0);

IMP: Acquired new "simverilog.c" from Burnie West.  Handles busses better.

BUG: On the Macintosh, the color picker displays incorrect colors
FIX: In "graphmac.c", the calls to "ForeColor()" must be replaced with a
     direct set of "gra_window->fgColor".

BUG: Auto-Gate Logic files with DIRECT sections are not being read properly.
FIX: In "ioaglin.c:io_aglreaddirect()", change the line:
	if (clbtype == -1) break;
    to:
	if (clbtype == -99) break;
    and change the line:
	if (x == -1) break;
    to:
	if (x == -99) break;

BUG: If there are no lines to edit, the point-and-click editor does not clear the
     window properly.
FIX: In "usreditpac.c:us_editpacmakeeditor()", change the lines:
	us_editpacsetheader(win, header);
	us_drawsliders(win);
	us_editpacinvertselection(e);
     to:
	us_editpacredrawscreen(win);

BUG: Crash if there are no design rules listed during technology edit.
FIX: In "usredtecc.c:us_teceddrcterm()", change the lines:
	(void)setval((INT32)el_curlib, VLIBRARY, "EDTEC_DRC", (INT32)lines,
	    VSTRING|VISARRAY|(j<<VLENGTHSH));
     to:
	if (j > 0)
	    (void)setval((INT32)el_curlib, VLIBRARY, "EDTEC_DRC", (INT32)lines,
		VSTRING|VISARRAY|(j<<VLENGTHSH));


IMP: The "Save as" and "Save vectors to disk" commands now have default
     file names.  Modified the "ofile" option of "terminal input" so that it
     takes a default file name as well as a prompt (the format is "prompt|default").
     Also fixed "graphmac.c:gra_waitforSF()" to switch directories when an
     output file has a ":" in it.

BUG: Interrupting redisplay must be done twice to cancel the opaque graphics too.
FIX: In "usr.c:us_slice()", changed the line:
	if (ttydataready() != 0) us_oncommand();
     to:
	el_pleasestop = 0;
	if (ttydataready() != 0) us_oncommand();
	if (el_pleasestop != 0) return;
     and in "usrwindow.c:us_endchanges()", changed the line:
	stopped = 0;
     to:
	stopped = el_pleasestop;

************************* Version 5.02a: Completed 9/28/93 *************************

IMP: Added two parameters to "dbcreate.c:modifynodeinst()", providing independent
     motion of each end of the arc.

IMP: Change two-port dialogs to use proper terms.  CCCS and VCVS units are "gain",
     VCCS units are transconductance, and CCVS units are transresistance.

BUG: Alignment of zero causes crash.
FIX: In "usrmisc.c:us_alignvalue()", place a test for "alignment == 0" before
     dividing by it.

BUG: Crash may occur during startup if "-more-" is required during key/button list.
FIX: In "usrcomrs.c:us_show()", must cache the arrays in the variables
     "USER_binding_keys" and "USER_binding_buttons" rather than caching the variables.

BUG: Technology editing may crash when converting back to a technology.
FIX: In "usredtecp.c:us_tecedmakenodes()", add the lines:
	tlist->layerlist = 0;
	tlist->layercount = 0;
     after the line:
	tlist->special = 0;

BUG: HPGL output may be scaled incorrectly for very large facets.
FIX: In "iohpglout.c", change the lines:
	io_hpwindow.uselx = io_hpwindow.screenlx = lx;
	io_hpwindow.usely = io_hpwindow.screenly = ly;
	io_hpwindow.usehx = io_hpwindow.screenhx = hx;
	io_hpwindow.usehy = io_hpwindow.screenhy = hy;
     to:
	io_hpwindow.uselx = 0;       io_hpwindow.screenlx = lx;
	io_hpwindow.usely = 0;       io_hpwindow.screenly = ly;
	io_hpwindow.usehx = 10000;   io_hpwindow.screenhx = hx;
	io_hpwindow.usehy = 10000;   io_hpwindow.screenhy = hy;
     change the lines:
	(void)sprintf(buff, "SC%d,%g,%d,%g,2;", io_hpwindow.screenlx, scale,
	    io_hpwindow.screenly, scale);
     to:
	(void)sprintf(buff, "SC%d,%g,%d,%g,2;", io_hpwindow.uselx, scale,
	    io_hpwindow.usely, scale);
     and change the lines:
	(void)sprintf(buff, "SC %d,%d,%d,%d,1;", io_hpwindow.screenlx, io_hpwindow.screenhx,
	    io_hpwindow.screenly, io_hpwindow.screenhy);
     to:
	(void)sprintf(buff, "SC %d,%d,%d,%d,1;", io_hpwindow.uselx, io_hpwindow.usehx,
	    io_hpwindow.usely, io_hpwindow.usehy);

BUG: Changing a textual facet's view doesn't cause its header or facet name to update.
FIX: In "usrcomtv.c:us_view()", must change WINDOW->editor->header to reflect the new
     facet name before calling "us_setfacetname()".

BUG: Textual facets can be made nontextual and visa-versa, causing internal errors.
FIX: Disallow the operation in "dbnoproto.c:changefacetview()".

BUG: VHDL generation may do damage to the infinite string package.
FIX: In "vhdl.c:vhdl_addstring()", do not use another infinite string, but
     instead, add to the current one only.

IMP: Added five new views: "netlist-netlisp-format", "netlist-als-format",
     "netlist-quisc-format", "netlist-rsim-format", and "netlist-silos-format".
     Also added PERMANENTVIEW bit to VIEW->viewstate.  Eliminates textual type
     checking by VHDL tool when netlist is read (simulation, silicon compiler).

IMP: New "graphx11.c" and "terminal.c" module from Queens handles separate status
     window.  Fixes also required in "usr.c" and "usrstatus.c" to handle "current
     facet" field of status window.

BUG: On system 7.1, highlighted text is drawn incorrectly.
FIX: Updated "graphmac.c:us_puttext()" to use search procs.

IMP: Added ability to read AutoGate Logic files.  Added the module "ioaglin.c";
     added the command: "library read LIB agl"; and added the GI command
     "FILE/Read External Library/Read AGL"

IMP: Removed all C++ keywords that were used as variables ("this", "new", "delete")

BUG: Extremely large binary files may not read because they have more than 32000
     nodes, ports, arcs, etc.
FIX: In the routines: "dbcreate.c:allocnodeinst()", "dbcreate.c:allocarcinst()",
     "dbcreate.c:allocportproto()", "dbcreate.c:allocportarcinst()",
     "dbcreate.c:allocportexpinst()", and "dbgeom.c:allocgeom()", change all "INT16"
     to "INT32", including the declaration of parameters.

IMP: Added network checking to the Macintosh version.  Enabled in "key.c" and
     checked by "macinter.c:mac_enternetwork()".

BUG: Redisplay is too slow.
FIX: Call "stopping()" less often in "usrdisp.c" (saved 33% on MAC).
     Macintosh "stopping()" only checks once per second (saved 17% on MAC).
     Recoded "graphmac.c:gra_setrect()" to use rectangle, not regions (saved 20% on MAC).
     Recoded screen transforms to use WINDOW->scalex/y (saved 9%).
     Recoded to avoid unnecessary calls to "makerot" in "dbmath.c:nodearea()",
     "dbtech.c:shapeportpoly()", "usrdisp.c:us_makeprotopoly()",
     "usrdisp.c:us_drawall()" (saved 10%).

BUG: Database checking may fail for very large databases.
FIX: In "usrcheck.c:us_checkdatabase()", change the variables "co" and "i" from
     INT16 to INT32.

BUG: Bound keys in the "meta" region print wrong.
FIX: In "usrstatus.c:us_keyname()" change "line" to "pt" in the "sprintf()" calls
     and everywhere else from that point to the "return" statement.

IMP: Can now specify bound keys in the "meta" region by typing "M-" before a key
     In the "bind set/get key KEY" command.

BUG: In Graphical Interface, typing a "%", "T", or "m" does some low-level command.
FIX: Fixed "fmacmenus.mac" and "gimenus.mac" to remove "T" and "m" and use two "%"s.

IMP: Added necessary Mathematica interface to the Electric database.

BUG: On the Macintosh, may crash if handle memory is coalesced.
FIX: In "graphmac.c", the global array "gra_rowstart" must be checked before being
     used since it points to a handle.  Added routine "graphmac.c:gra_rebuildrowstart()"

BUG: Area selection of many objects is too slow.
FIX: Improved "usrtrack.c:us_findiup()" to directly generate the highlight information.

IMP: Fixed "graphmac.c" to be able to handle GWORLD calls and to use "WaitNextEvent".

BUG: When creating a file on UNIX, no default file is shown in the dialog.
FIX: In "usrdiacom1.c:tty_fileodlog()", add the line:
	DiaSetText(4, defofile);
     after the line:
	DiaSetText(3, prompt);

BUG: When reading a file on UNIX, the file names are not sorted.
FIX: In "usrdiacom1.c:tty_filedlog()", change the "-1" to a "0" in the call to
     "DiaInitTextDialog()" and the two calls to "DiaLoadTextDialog()"

BUG: HPGL output crashes.
FIX: In "iohpglout.c", change the line:
	varscale = getval((INT32)io_aid, VAID, "IO_hpgl2_scale", VINTEGER);
     to be:
	varscale = getval((INT32)io_aid, VAID, VINTEGER, "IO_hpgl2_scale");

IMP: Added Logic Synthesis module "ls.c".

IMP: Able to resume SPICE simulation display with standard "tellaid simulation resume"

BUG: Undoing the creation or deletion of nonstandard window types (i.e. simulation
     windows, text windows, etc.) can crash.
FIX: System-wide change to the way windows are handled.  Rather than changing the
     fields in a window, a new one is created.  The "termhandler" routine is
     called in change control.  EDITOR structures are not freed until the deletion
     change is purged.

BUG: On Non-Macintosh systems, command keys on submenus are not recognized.
FIX: In "usrmenu.c:us_scanforkeyequiv()", change the line:
	if (mi->response->menu != NOPOPUPMENU) continue;
     to:
	if (mi->response->menu != NOPOPUPMENU)
	{
	    us_scanforkeyequiv(mi->response->menu);
	    continue;
	}

IMP: When reading SPICE2 or SPICE3 output files, the system detects HSPICE files and
     warns of the improper format.

IMP: If an arc is moved and only one end can slide, then it does (extended special
     code in "usrnet.c:us_manymove()" when one arc is being moved).

IMP: Added "i" command to SPICE simulation window to show value at white cursor.

IMP: Added more popup menus in "Variables" and "New Facet" dialogs.

IMP: Added dragging bar to all dialogs that didn't have it.

************************* Version 5.01a: Completed 4/1/93 *************************

IMP: Redid graphics in "tecschem.c:sch_twoportccvs_l[]" and
     "tecschem.c:sch_twoportcccs_l[]" for CCVS and CCCS so that current
     loop line on left is dashed.

IMP: Doing "get info" on analog part text that was created with special
     value dialog returns to that dialog for a new value.

IMP: Added popup menus in dialogs: Text info, Port info, New port, Text defaults,
     Lambda, Resistance, Capacitance, Inductance, Siemens, Area, Length/Width,
     Artwork color, Spice options.

IMP: Changed "simulation-output" view to be "simulation-snapshot" view (only
     needed to change string in "dbmath.c:db_initdatabase()").

BUG: EDIF input crashes if the current technology has GDS layers.
FIX: In "ioedifi.c:ed_pop_stack()" fixed the allocation bug in the GDS case.
     Also improved the module to show progress during input and to use Electric's
     allocation routines.

BUG: GDS input does not handle multi-segment paths with a flush endtype (corners
     are missing:
FIX: Improvements (from Queens) to "iogdsi.c:io_gdsIdetermine_path()".

BUG: Null facet and port names are allowed.
FIX: Added tests in "dbnoproto.c:newnodeproto()" and "dbcreate.c:newportproto()"
     for null names.

IMP: Made free choice dialog moveable.  Now most dialogs are.

IMP: Binary file searches on UNIX systems now require the ".lib" extension.
     Added "topoflibfile()" to "dbtext.c".

IMP: Extended the "Default Arc" dialog to allow specification of default pins.

BUG: TEGAS simulation output crashes if there are errors in the circuit.
FIX: Rewrote "simtexsim.c:sim_texerror()" to not use fixed arrays.

IMP: Made common simulation window that is used by SPICE output parsing and
     ALS.  Added ability to cross-probe networks in simulation and text windows.
     Added "network.c:net_parsenetwork()" which augments
     "network.c:net_gethighlightednet()" to handle waveform and text windows.
     All calls to "net_gethighlightednet()" no longer need to test for current
     window having a facet, but they must use "net->parent" rather than
     "el_curwindow->curnodeproto".  Also updated "tellaid network highlight"
     to show in simulation and text windows (and call "equate" if there are any).
     Also modified "vhdl.c" to put out true node names in "vhdl.c:vhdl_convertfacet()".

IMP: All files that are created use Macintosh-like dialog first.  Added new
     parameter to "dbtext.c:xcreate()" to request dialog.  Use it everywhere.
     Controlled by "terminal [not] display-dialogs".

IMP: Added command "window measure" to interactively stretch a line and report its length.
     Also added this to the graphical interface as "Measure Distance" in INFO menu.

BUG: Very large components (for example, 1" square which is 50 million units)
     have incorrect geometry.
FIX: In "dbtech.c:subrange()", change the lines:
	*newlow = total/2 + size*lowmul/WHOLE + lowsum*lambda/WHOLE;
	*newhigh = (total+1)/2 + size*highmul/WHOLE + highsum*lambda/WHOLE;
     to:
	if (size > 17895697)
	{
	    *newlow = total/2 + muldiv(size, lowmul, WHOLE) + lowsum*lambda/WHOLE;
	    *newhigh = (total+1)/2 + muldiv(size, highmul, WHOLE) + highsum*lambda/WHOLE;
	} else
	{
	    *newlow = total/2 + size*lowmul/WHOLE + lowsum*lambda/WHOLE;
	    *newhigh = (total+1)/2 + size*highmul/WHOLE + highsum*lambda/WHOLE;
	}
     and in "dbtech.c:getrange()", insert the lines:
	if (high-low > 17895697)
	    return(total/2 + muldiv(high-low, mul, WHOLE) + sum*lambda/WHOLE);
     before the last line.


BUG: Blank lines in the DRC rules of technology edit cause errors.
FIX: In "usredtecc.c:us_teceddrcchange()", "usredtecc.c:us_teceddrcterm()", and
     "usredtecp.c:us_tecedmakelayers()", ignore null strings before calling
     "us_tecedgetdrc()".

IMP: Made Macintosh remember window locations as well as status font.

IMP: Made UNIX pulldown menus use Meta key prefix.  Required these changes:
     Changed "NUMKEYS" from 128 to 256 in "usr.h".
     Or-ed 0200 to the key value in "usrmenu.c:us_scanforkeyequiv()".
     Changed mask from 127 to 255 in "us_parsebinding" calls in
     "usr.c:us_charhandler()", "usrcomab.c:us_bind()"

BUG: Fonts may be incorrect if dialog window is redrawn ("uncovered" on X).
FIX: In "usrdialogs.c:DiaRedrawDialogWindow()", insert the line:
	Dsettextsmall(-1);
     before the call to "Dnewdialogwindowframe()".

IMP: Text on invisible nodes is now treated as a node for the purposes of
     selection, editing, etc.

IMP: Changed highlight color in white background and black background color maps
     from gray to red to make it more visible.

IMP: Added "search" routine in text editors.  Added "text find" command to invoke
     the search, and added "Text Find" menu entry in graphical interface.

IMP: Added the variable "USER_text_editor" on the user aid to hold the current
     editor, making editor switching undoable.

IMP: Added database routines "insind" and "insindkey" to insert an entry into
     an array variable, and the routines "delind" and "delindkey" to delete an
     entry in an array variable.  Also added the "insertvariable" and "deletevariable"
     routines in both AID and CONSTRAINT objects.

IMP: Improved "iohpglout.c" so that it produces full HPGL including filled areas,
     correct arcs, merged polygons, and more.  Expanded features of "hp_penfile".
     Also added HPGL/2 capability, with dialog options and the command:
     "tellaid io hpgl [1 | 2 [scale HMMperPIXEL]]"

IMP: Made technology descriptions be independent of the actual layercount/arcprotocount/
     nodeprotocount fields in the static data structure (in "tectable.c").
     Each list in a technology file is -1 terminated.  The calculation of sizes is
     done in "dbtechi.c:tech_doinitprocess()".  The routines "us_teceditdumplayers()",
     "us_teceditdumparcs()", and "us_teceditdumpnodes()" in "usredtecg.c" now write
     termination in their lists.  The routines "us_tecedmakelayers()",
     "us_tecedmakearcs()", and "us_tecedmakenodes()" in "usredtecp.c" now create
     null-terminated lists.

IMP: Improved method used by text editors to report incremental changes.  Now reports
     insertions and deletions as well as modifications.  PAC editor generates these
     change reports.  Improved text editing hooks to have cut/copy/paste/undo.  Also
     added LINESFIXED bit in EDITOR->state to prevent line rearrangement.

IMP: Added dialogs with real units for resistance, capacitance, inductance, siemens,
     area, and width/length.

IMP: Added a substrate component in the "schematic" technology.  Put it and the Well
     near Power and Ground in the Analog Schematic technology menu.

IMP: Added two-port component to "schematic" technology.  This allows 6 varieties:
     general two-port-in/two-port-out, voltage controlled voltage source (VCVS),
     voltage controlled current source (VCCS), current controlled voltage source (CCVS),
     current controlled current source (CCCS), and a transmission line.  Put them
     in the analog schematic menu.  Added them to the node get-info dialog.

BUG: Emacs line insertion may not work right near the end of large files.
FIX: In the '\n' case of "usreditemacs.c:us_editemacsimplementchar(), added:
	for(i=e->maxlines-1; i>=0; i--) if (e->textarray[i][0] != 0) break;
     before the line:
	for(e->curline = i+1; e->curline >= savecur; e->curline--)

IMP: Added linkage to Mathematica (Macintosh only).  This requires four new libraries
     in the Mac project (MathLink1-32.lib, MathLink2-32.lib, MacTraps2, and nAppleTalk).
     It also requires inclusion of all of the resources in the file
     "MathLink for THINK C:MathLink Resources:mathlink.rsrc" in the THINK_C folder.
     The variable type constant VCODE is now VCODE1 and there is a new bit VCODE2
     which combines to produce four language options: 0, VLISP, VPROLOG, and VMATHEMATICA.
     The routines "languageconverse", "load_code", and "doquerry" now take a
     "language" argument.  The "interpret" command now takes a language option.  The
     "var" command now takes multiple "language" options.  The "Variables..." dialog
     now has multiple language options.

IMP: Added a pure point-and-click editor (usreditpac.c) to replace the macintosh one.

IMP: When ports are reexported, the text offset fields are copied.  This is done
     in "usrcomoq.c:us_port() by adding the line:
	if (ni->proto->index == 0) ppt->textdescript = pp->textdescript;
     and in "usrnet.c:us_reexportport()", change the line:
	ppt->textdescript = pp->textdescript & (VTPOSITION|VTROTATION|VTSIZE|VTFONT);
     to:
	ppt->textdescript = pp->textdescript

BUG: Key-secured functions cannot be executed by commands in the "cadrc" startup file.
FIX: Changed all key checking code to call "checkcap", which immediately checks keys.

IMP: Modified "outhier" to give popup menu of choices if an exported port is
     selected.  Also modified "editfacet" to keep the highlighting if a port
     on an instance is selected.

IMP: Added percentage dialog to "iobinaryi.c", "ioapple.c", "iotext.c", "iocifin.c",
     "iocifpars.c", "iogdsi.c".  Changed command "tellaid io verbose list-facets-read"
     to "tellaid io verbose graphical".

IMP: Technology conversion can now go from schematic to layout.  Changed names of
     technology translation commands in the VIEW menu of the GI system.

IMP: Information dialogs (node, arc, text, and polygon) now ignore the "OK"
     if no changes were made to the dialog fields.

IMP: Added ability to specify textual views (both a dialog option and a command
     option: "view new NAME ABBREV text").

IMP: Added "iohpglout.c" to write "HPGL" output directly.

IMP: New "graphx11.c" module from Queen's University that reads ".Xdefaults"
     for font information and backing store operation.

IMP: New "iopsout.c" from Queen's University to handle encapsulated PostScript
     better and WYSIWYG fonts.

IMP: Added "editfacet -" command to follow the current network down (or up
     if an exported port is selected), possibly prompting with a popup menu
     to select the destination facet (from Burnie West).

************************* Version 5.00g: Completed 1/4/93 *************************

BUG: On the SUN, the ALS simulation window only accepts its own commands and
     does not allow general window-manipulation commands to be issued from the
     keyboard.
FIX: In "simals.c:sim_alscharhandler()", change the lines:
	ttyputerr("Unknown simulation command: %c", chr);
	return(0);
     to:
	return(us_charhandler(w, chr));
     and declare "us_charhandler" to be INT16.

BUG: Components can be placed in text-only facets.
FIX: In "usrcomcd.c:us_create()" and in "usrcomek.c:us_find()" place this code at the top:
	if (us_needfacet()) return;
	if ((el_curwindow->curnodeproto->cellview->viewstate&TEXTVIEW) != 0)
	{
	    us_abortcommand("APPROPRIATE ERROR MESSAGE, either:
		Cannot place components in a text-only facet
		    or
		There are no components to select in a text-only facet");
	    return;
	}

BUG: Generation of VHDL may crash on complex facets.
FIX: In "vhdl.c:vhdl_print()", change the declaration of "buff" from 256 to 4000.

BUG: Incorrect declarations for some compilers.
FIX: Changed "k" from INT16 to INT32 in "usrmisc.c:us_figuretechopaque()".
     Changed "net" from INT16 to INT32 in "usredtecp.c:us_tecedmakenodes()".
     Changed "exponent" from INT16 to INT32 in "iogdso.c:io_gds_cvfloat8()".
     Two calls to "iogdsi.c:io_gdsIgetrawbyte()" which shift their result by
     16 must be cast, one to "(unsigned long)" and the other to "(UINT32)".

BUG: Examination of R-tree nodes may cause a crash.
FIX: In "dbgeom.c:allocrtnode()", add the lines:
	rtn->numvar = 0;
	rtn->firstvar = NOVARIABLE;
     before the return.  Also in "dbgeom.c:freertnode()" must add the lines:
	if (rtn->firstvar != NOVARIABLE)
	    db_freevars(&rtn->firstvar, &rtn->numvar);
     before the "myfree" call.  Finally, in "dbnoproto.c:allocnodeproto()" add the line:
	np->rtree = NORTNODE;
     before the return.

BUG: When creating new technology library NOT from existing conversion, color map
     editing screws up color map.
FIX: In "usredtecc.c:us_teceditcolormap()", simplify the lines:
	var = getval((INT32)el_curlib, VLIBRARY, VINTEGER|VISARRAY,
	    "EDTEC_colormap");
	if (var != NOVARIABLE)
	{
	    mapptr = (INT32 *)var->addr;

     to just 1 line:
	us_tecedloadlibmap(el_curlib);

BUG: Exiting technology edit on the GI (not Mac) causes an error message.
FIX: In the file "gimenus.mac", change the line:
	bind set button right pmdclick
     to:
	bind set button right find port extra-info more interactive

BUG: Examining the network on a primitive port prototype causes a crash
FIX: In "network.c:net_redoprim()", add the lines:
	primnetlist[j]->arccount = 0;
	primnetlist[j]->refcount = 0;
	primnetlist[j]->portcount = 0;
	primnetlist[j]->buslinkcount = 0;
	primnetlist[j]->numvar = 0;
     after the line:
	primnetlist[j]->netname = NOSTRING;

************************* Version 5.00f: Completed 11/19/92 *************************

BUG: If the contents of a facet changes such that the bounding box shifts but does
     not change in size, some instances may not get moved.
FIX: In "conlay.c:cla_computefacet()", remove the lines:
	if (ni->highx-ni->lowx == nhx-nlx && ni->highy-ni->lowy == nhy-nly)
	    nlx = nhx = nly = nhy = 0; else

BUG: Offpage connectors in the Schematic technology can connect with wires perpendicular
     to their body.
FIX: In "tecschem.c", changed the range of connectivity from 90 to 45 on port "a".

BUG: Technology editor placed FET transistor polysilicon ports incorrectly.
FIX: Improved "usredtecp.c:us_tecedmakenodes()" to order ports exactly:
     poly-left, diff-top, poly-right, diff-bottom

BUG: Technologies with duplicate node/arc/layer names cause crashes.
FIX: In "usredtecp.c:us_teceditfindsequence()", change the code at the end from:

	{
	    np = nplist[l];
	    if (np != NONODEPROTO) (*sequence)[k++] = np;
	}

BUG: When replacing arcs, total size is kept constant, so actual size may change.
FIX: In "dbnoproto.c:replacearcinst()", offset new arc width by
	arcwidthoffset(ai->proto) + arcwidthoffset(ap)

BUG: If SPICE crashes, simulation environment becomes inconsistent.  Also, some warning
     messages are written to the SPICE deck without comments.
FIX: In "simspicerun.c" must terminate process information on error.  Also
     fixed messages in "simspice.c"

BUG: In the graphical interface, many button commands cause polygon edit to
     fail or crash.
FIX: Disable all other button combinations except the relevant ones in the
     macro files.

BUG: In the graphical interface, converting textual views to a skeleton, icon, or
     other nonsensical form gives an error message, but still splits the window.
FIX: Must detect failure in the macro package and exit.

BUG: VHDL generation misses some transistor component declarations.
FIX: In "vhdl.c:vhdl_convertfacet()", must keep a list of component names that
     have been written, instead of marking the prototypes.

BUG: Iconification creates nonaligned icons.
FIX: In "usrnet.c:us_makeiconfacet()", change the declarations of "xsize", "ysize",
     "xpos", "ypos", "xbbpos", "ybbpos", and "spacing" from INT16 to INT32.

************************* Version 5.00e: Completed 10/29/92 *************************

BUG: Rotation of transposed objects with the "about-grab-point" or "about-trace-point"
     options fails.
FIX: In "usrcomrs.c:us_rotate()", after the calls to "atofr", add the line:
	if (ni->transpose != 0) amt = -amt;

BUG: Technologies with outlined stipple patterns do not appear so in the
     technology editor.
FIX: In "usredtecg.c:us_tecedmakelibfromtech()", change the line:
	desc->style[COLORMAP]&NATURE, lay, layerfunction(tech, i),
     to:
	desc->style[COLORMAP]&(NATURE|OUTLINEPAT), lay, layerfunction(tech, i),

BUG: GDS layers generated by the technology editor are stored with incorrect
     variable names.
FIX: Change "IO_gds_layer_names" to "IO_gds_layer_numbers" in the files:
     "tecbicmos.c", "tecbipolar.c", "teccmosdodn.c", "tecmocmos2.c", and
     "usredtecg.c"

BUG: GDS layers get destroyed when a "c" file is generated from the technology editor.

	w->screenhy =  el_curtech->deflambda * 10;

BUG: "tecbicmos.c" is missing the poly-to-poly connection on PTRANS nodes.  It also
     has a duplicate "Active" layer.  Both have been fixed.

BUG: Cursor coordinates are swapped in status window
FIX: Reverse "x" and "y" in "usrstatus.c:us_setcursorpos()".  Also have to
     reverse "tech" and "lambda" positions in "graphmac.c:gra_rearrange[]".

BUG: CIF output is 20 times too large.
FIX: In "iocifout.c" must scale all values down by "TEXTUNITMICRON / 100" to make
     it in centimicrons.  In "iocifin.c", all calls to "newnodeinst" must
     scale their arguments up by this amount.

BUG: The "Technology Variables" dialog crashes if there are no items in the
     list when "OK" is clicked.
FIX: In "usrdiacom1.c:tty_techvarsdlog()", do not do the "setval"s at the end
     "OK" code if "j" is zero (if there are no variables).

BUG: Technology editor still doesn't handle field effect transistor ports
     right.
FIX: In "usredtecp.c:us_tecedmakenodes()", when the diffusion ports are tested
     to make sure that port 1 is higher than port 2, the port contents must be
     swapped, but the pointers reswapped (restored).

BUG: When "create angle" is used on directional nodes with variable position ports
     (i.e. AND, OR, XOR), the cursor position is not used, and an arbitrary position
     on the input side is chosen.
FIX: In "usrcomcd.c:us_create()", before the last call to "aconnect", change the
     computation of "xcur" and "ycur" from:
	xcur = (ni->lowx + ni->highx)/2 + mult(cosine(k), ni->highx-ni->lowx);
	ycur = (ni->lowy + ni->highy)/2 + mult(sine(k), ni->highy-ni->lowy);
     to:
	xcur = x + mult(cosine(k), ni->highx-ni->lowx);
	ycur = y + mult(sine(k), ni->highy-ni->lowy);

IMP: Added ICDA MOSIS CMOS

BUG: EMACS text editor may crash if there are blank lines in file being read in.
FIX: In "usremacs.c:us_emacsimplementchar()", the carriage-return case code:
	for(i=e->maxlines-1; i>=0; i--) if (e->textarray[i][0] != 0) break;
	if (i >= e->maxlines-1) us_emacsaddmorelines(e);
     should be:
	if (e->curline >= e->maxlines-1) us_emacsaddmorelines(e);

IMP: Modified the node "get info" dialog so that rotated nodes properly show
     the grab-point as their position.

BUG: Frozen interfaces written to a library may not read in properly.
FIX: In "usr.c:us_readlibrary()", the parsing of popup menus from a library must
     be done in two passes: the first creates all popups and the second fills
     them (with calls to "us_setcommand()" which presume all popups exist).

IMP: Added SPICE options dialog to graphical interface.

IMP: Added "/" to directory names in UNIX file dialogs.

BUG: Technology documentation may crash.
FIX: In "usrctech.c:us_printtechnology()", change the line:
	fieldname = us_teclayer_colors[i].name;
     to:
	fieldname = us_teclayer_colors[j].name;

IMP: Added statistics gathering on menu usage (added to "usrmenu.c").

IMP: Added ELK LISP 1.5 to Electric.  This is a permanent part of the system.
     Removed AIDPROLOG from "global.h".  Removed Gate Matrix and Verify tools.
     Removed Franz and Lucid LISP options, Edinburgh, AAIS, and Quintus Prolog
     options.  There is now only ELK LISP.

IMP: Added new node function: TRANE2L (E2L transistor) and added many new layer
     functions: LFPOLY3, LFGATE, LFPLUG, LFRESISTOR, LFCAP, LFEMITTER, LFBASE,
     and LFCOLLECTOR.

IMP: Modified "usrmenu.c:us_drawmenuentry()" to scale all nodes of a given class
     together, but independently of other objects in the menu.  Pins and arcs
     arc scaled together.

BUG: Nonmanhattan geometry gets incorrect GEOM bounds computation after being
     read from disk.
FIX: Must call "setshrinkvalue" before calling "linkgeom".  Thus, the calls to
     "setshrinkvalue" are removed from "io.c:io_fixnewlib()" and placed in the
     two readers: "iobinaryi.c" and "iotext.c".  In "iobinaryi.c" it is
     placed in "io_doreadlibrary()" just before the "linkgeom()" call.  In
     "iotext.c" it is more difficult since the PORTARCINST fields are not
     computed until the entire library is read, and that is needed for the
     "setshrinkvalue" code.  Therefore, the PORTARCINST computation work is
     moved from the end of "io_readtextlibrary()" to the beginning of
     "io_celdon()", and a "setshrinkvalue()" call is placed in "io_celdon()"
     before the "linkgeom()" call.

BUG: On system 7, the "Messages Window Font" command doesn't work.
FIX: In "graphmac.c:gra_setfont()", look for "FOND" if "FONT" is not found.

IMP: Fixed "usrarc.c:aconnect()" so that arcs from other technologies are only
     used when the two nodes are in different technologies.

BUG: Setting SPICE output format doesn't work right
FIX: Improved code in "sim.c" for the "tellaid simulation spice format" command.

IMP: Changed the size of the "infstrlength" and "infstrptr" fields in the
     INFSTR structure of "dbtext.c" to INT32.

IMP: New commands: "text default-style STYLE" and "text default-size SIZE"
     set defaults for text.  Also new routine: "defaulttextdescript()" to
     return the current default text descriptor.  New GI interface dialog.

IMP: Macintosh startup offers a quit if the menu bar is on the wrong display.

IMP: Added special case graphics for more variations of the Schematic:Source
     node (i.e. AC, Bulk).  Added more source variations to GI menus

IMP: GDS layer 0 is now supported (layer -1 is used to indicate NO layer).

BUG: SPICE area calculations may be wrong.
FIX: Polygon merging code accumulates areas in an integer which can overflow.
     The area calculation is now done in floating point.

BUG: Network consistency checking may fail and possibly crash.  Also, it does
     not recognize power/ground/exports properly.
FIX: In "netdiff.c:net_scancomplist()", when checking for subsequent component
     movement after moving a component, "next" list pointers can be destroyed.
     After the last two calls to "net_movecomp()", must insert the line
	if (np == nextp) nextp = nnextp;
     The fix to power/ground/exports is as follows:
     At the end of "netflat.c:net_buildpseudo()", the lines:
	pcomp->netnumbers[i]->flags = POWERNET;
	pcomp->netnumbers[i]->flags = GROUNDNET;
    should be:
	pcomp->netnumbers[i]->flags |= POWERNET;
	pcomp->netnumbers[i]->flags |= GROUNDNET;
     In the routine "netflat.c:net_makepseudo()", the lines:
	if (net->flags == POWERNET) (*powernets)++;
	if (net->flags == GROUNDNET) (*groundnets)++;
     should be:
	if ((net->flags&POWERNET) != 0) (*powernets)++;
	if ((net->flags&GROUNDNET) != 0) (*groundnets)++;
     Finally, in the routine "netflat.c:net_newpnet()", add the line:
	p->flags = 0;
     Before the return

IMP: When HSPICE is selected in the Graphical interface, the "use-nodenames"
     option of SPICE is also turned on.

IMP: Technology editor now reorders ports on any FET transistor, not just those
     marked "serpentine".

IMP: Modified "netdiff.c" to accept parallel-wired components as unambiguous
     (added "net_allalike()" to test).

IMP: Added "debug swap-length-and-width" to swap all length/width values on
     schematic transistors in the current library

IMP: DRC now checks for special transistor proximity situation: if two pieces of
     active layer are too close, and they are connected to either side of a
     field-effect transistor which is inside of their bounding area, then there
     is no error.

IMP: Single click in the graphical interface keeps the selection if there is one.
     Double-click (right button on non-Mac) finds another but does not move.
     This is done by having the "find" command take the "more" option in conjunction
     with "interactive" to find another.  Network highlighting has been moved to the
     ARC menu.

IMP: Made database check handle arcs that have no valid portarcinst (creates one).

BUG: If there are only pure-layer nodes in a technology, automatic menu sizing fails
FIX: In "usrcomln.c:us_menu()", if there are no components or pins, make the
     pure-layer nodes fit in the menu.

IMP: Added the routine "filesize" to tell the size of a stream.

BUG: Values that are 1999 half-millimicrons over (1 hmm under) do not print right.
FIX: In "dbtext.c:latoa()", check for fractional values of 1000/1000 and adjust.

IMP: SPARCs should use "dbmult.c" (not the assembly language) and have SHIFT30
     defined in "database.h"

BUG: Skeletonization ignores some ports
FIX: In "usrcomcd.c:us_copyfacet()" do not use the "temp1" field on nodes to
     restrict port creation.

BUG: Graphical facet plots are incorrect
FIX: Must multiply the constants XSCALE, YSCALE, and YOFFSET by 20 in "usrgraph.c".

IMP: Possible problems with layout constraints:
     (1) when arc is jogged, portarcinst list gets rearranged in the middle of a
     loop on it.  Therefore, in "conlay.c", the routines "cla_modwithin()",
     "cla_modfixed()", and "cla_modflex()" must precompute the list of arcs and
     test each one to see if it has been killed before using it from the list.
     (2) in "conlay.c:cla_domovearcinst()", the jogged arc should be deleted
     after the new arcs are created, not before.

IMP: Technology editor now checks for invalid port names.

IMP: Removed the EPS conditional on the "showpage" command in "iopsout.c".

IMP: Unified variable names (the ones with "*" are converted on readin):
     Changed "SIM_behave_rise_delay" (*), "LOGIC_tex_rise_delay", and
	"SIM_verilog_rise_delay" to "SIM_rise_delay"
     Changed "SIM_behave_fall_delay" (*), "LOGIC_tex_fall_delay", and
	"SIM_verilog_fall_delay" to "SIM_fall_delay"
     Changed "SIM_verilog_off_delay" to "SIM_off_delay"
     Changed "SILOS_global_name" (*) to "SIM_silos_global_name"
     Changed "SIM_silos_behave_file" (*) to "SIM_silos_behavior_file"
     Changed "SIM_generic_behavior" to "SIM_generic_behavior_file"
     Changed "SIM_verilog_behave" to "SIM_verilog_behavior_file"
     Changed "SILOS_node_name" to use "SIM_silos_node_name"
     Changed "GEN_node_name" to use "SIM_generic_node_name"
     Changed "VER_node_name" to use "SIM_verilog_node_name"
     Changed "SPICE_model_file" (*) to use "SIM_spice_model_file"
     Changed "SPICE_trailer_file" (*) to use "SIM_spice_trailer_file"

BUG: When "peeking" onto a rotated facet instance, not everything inside is drawn.
FIX: In "usrdisp.c:us_drawall()", the code that looks at only two points (lx,ly)
     and (hx,hy) must be expanded to look at all four points of the instance, so:
	xform(lx, ly, &newlx, &newly, this);
	xform(hx, hy, &newhx, &newhy, this);
	if (newlx > newhx) { swap = newlx;  newlx = newhx;  newhx = swap; }
	if (newly > newhy) { swap = newly;  newly = newhy;  newhy = swap; }
     becomes:
	xform(lx, ly, &newlx, &newly, this);   newhx = newlx;   newhy = newly;
	xform(lx, hy, &newx, &newy, this);
	if (newx < newlx) newlx = newx;   if (newx > newhx) newhx = newx;
	if (newy < newly) newly = newy;   if (newy > newhy) newhy = newy;
	xform(hx, ly, &newx, &newy, this);
	if (newx < newlx) newlx = newx;   if (newx > newhx) newhx = newx;
	if (newy < newly) newly = newy;   if (newy > newhy) newhy = newy;
	xform(hx, hy, &newx, &newy, this);
	if (newx < newlx) newlx = newx;   if (newx > newhx) newhx = newx;
	if (newy < newly) newly = newy;   if (newy > newhy) newhy = newy;

BUG: Crashes when trying to print out 3-decimal-point lambda values.
FIX: In "dbtext.c:latoa()", change "temp[4]" to "temp[5]".

************************* Version 5.00d: Completed 4/21/92 *************************

BUG: When text libraries have variables on unknown technologies, it crashes.
FIX: In "iotext.c:io_getvar()", test for invalid address and ignore variable set.

IMP: New version of "iogdso.c" from Queens fixes rotation problem.

BUG: Rapid clicking while moving the cursor appears as double-clicks
FIX: In "graphmac.c" and "graphx11.c" check not only last time of click but
     also last location.

BUG: PostScript output focuses on an incorrect place.
FIX: In the routine "iopsout.c:io_writepostscriptlibrary()", change the lines:
	io_pswindow.screenly = hx;
	io_pswindow.screenhx = ly;
     to:
	io_pswindow.screenhx = hx;
	io_pswindow.screenly = ly;
     and also change the line:
	(void)askaid(us_aid, "display-to-routine", io_pspoly);
     to:
	sulx = el_curwindow->uselx;      suhx = el_curwindow->usehx;
	suly = el_curwindow->usely;      suhy = el_curwindow->usehy;
	sslx = el_curwindow->screenlx;   sshx = el_curwindow->screenhx;
	ssly = el_curwindow->screenly;   sshy = el_curwindow->screenhy;
	el_curwindow->uselx = io_pswindow.uselx;   el_curwindow->usehx = io_pswindow.usehx;
	el_curwindow->usely = io_pswindow.usely;   el_curwindow->usehy = io_pswindow.usehy;
	el_curwindow->screenlx = io_pswindow.screenlx;
	el_curwindow->screenhx = io_pswindow.screenhx;
	el_curwindow->screenly = io_pswindow.screenly;
	el_curwindow->screenhy = io_pswindow.screenhy;
	(void)askaid(us_aid, "display-to-routine", io_pspoly);
	el_curwindow->uselx = sulx;      el_curwindow->usehx = suhx;
	el_curwindow->usely = suly;      el_curwindow->usehy = suhy;
	el_curwindow->screenlx = sslx;   el_curwindow->screenhx = sshx;
	el_curwindow->screenly = ssly;   el_curwindow->screenhy = sshy;

BUG: "Write PostScript" and "Write PostScript Highlighted" do the same thing.
FIX: In the macro files (fmacmenus.mac and gimenus.mac), change the "tellaid"
     line of the "pmfiextw" macro to read:
	tellaid user tellaid io plot %3 focus

BUG: The auto-router sometimes connects objects that should not be connected.
FIX: Rather than allow any layer to intersect when testing for a hit, it now
     requires that the smallest layer of the connecting arc be used.

IMP: The "Get Info" dialog for node instances reverses X and Y if the object
     is rotated exactly sideways.

IMP: Binary input prompts for a new arc type if the one in the file does not exist.

BUG: "create angle" doesn't always find the closest object to connect to.
FIX: Modified "usrnet.c:us_getclosest()" to truly find the closest object.

BUG: Geometric search uses memory that is never freed.
FIX: A new routine: "termsearch" is available for calling when the "initsearch/
     nextobject" loop terminates prematurely.  This happens in "drc.c:dr_badbox()",
     "rout.c:ro_checkstitching()", "usrdisp.c:us_drawall()",
     "usredtecp.c:us_tecedgetexamples()","usrnet.c:us_getclosest()", and
     "usrtrack.c:us_findiup()"

IMP: Made a graphical interface dialog to do help.  Replaces both the "Mac
     Help Files" and the "Graphical Interface Help" directories with a single
     library file "GI.help".

IMP: Modified stitching router to NOT place a wire if an electrical connection
     already exists.

BUG: When "create angle" is used on directional nodes, the direction is not
     enforced, and the wire runs incorrectly.
FIX: In "usrcomcd.c:us_create()", changed the "runarcinst" call to be a call
     to "aconnect" when the port is directional.

BUG: Edit fields in dialogs do not handle messages too wide for the field.
FIX: Rewrote edit text handler in "usrdialogs.c".

IMP: Moved default path setting code from "langno.c" and "macinter.c" down to
     "usr.c".  It is now available to systems with the built-in language.

IMP: Stipple patterns can now be outlined.  Added the bit OUTLINEPAT to the
     "style" field of GRAPHICS.  Also modified the semantics of the "ART_pattern"
     variable in the Artwork technology: if it is composed of INTEGER, no outline;
     if it is composed of SHORT, outline.

BUG: Short array variables do not work.
FIX: In "dbvars.c:db_setvalvar()", change the lines:
	inaddr = (char *)(newaddr + i*datasize);
	if (db_setval(inaddr, &((char *)var->addr)[i*datasize], newtype,
	    cluster) != 0) return(1);
     to:
	if ((newtype&VTYPE) == VSHORT)
	{
	    longval = ((INT16 *)newaddr)[i];
	    if (db_setval(&longval, &((char *)var->addr)[i*datasize], newtype,
		cluster) != 0) return(1);
	} else
	{
	    inaddr = (char *)(newaddr + i*datasize);
	    if (db_setval(inaddr, &((char *)var->addr)[i*datasize], newtype,
		cluster) != 0) return(1);
	}

IMP: Added a graphical interface dialog to control default paths (help and lib).

IMP: To enable lambda and units to be set independently, moved the units control
     from the "lambda" command to the "technology units TECH UNITS" command.

BUG: The pulldown command "Read Technology Library" does not set menu properly
FIX: Fixed command file to do "menu size auto"

BUG: Angle fields are incorrect if units are not set to Lambda.
FIX: Use "atofr" and "frtoa" instead of "atola" and "latoa" with all
     degree values.

BUG: When doing "Save as", it may ask what object is to be renamed.
FIX: Added third parameter to "rename" command to specify object to be renamed.

IMP: Fixed Silicon compiler so that if p-well size is zero, it doesn't look for
     a well layer (in "sc1electric.c:Sc_setup_for_maker()") and therefore doesn't
     place one.

IMP: HSPICE now writes length and width for NJFET, PJFET, DMES, and EMES devices.

BUG: Network bus evaluation may crash in code-generated circuits.
FIX: In "network.c:net_mergebuswires()", reverse the order of the following tests:
	if (cnet->signals <= 1 && ocnet->signals <= 1) continue;
	if (cnet == ocnet) continue;

BUG: When a popup menu is at the bottom of the screen, it may crash
FIX: In "usrmenu.c:us_popupmenu()", replace the code:
	if (us_pmcur.posy < 0)
	{
	    us_pmcur.yshift = -us_pmcur.posy;
	    us_pmcur.posy = 0;
	}
     With:
	if (us_pmcur.posy <= MENUSHADOW)
	{
	    us_pmcur.yshift = MENUSHADOW+1-us_pmcur.posy;
	    us_pmcur.posy = MENUSHADOW+1;
	}

IMP: Made binary libraries always use "lib" extension.

IMP: Made GDS input print progress: every 100,000 bytes.

IMP: The command "technology document TECHNAME" writes a technology document file.

BUG: Technology editor sometimes places node geometry too close to factors
FIX: Computed proper position for geometry in "usredtecg.c:us_tecedmakelibfromtech()".

IMP: Technology editor prints warning messages if:
     1) there is no pure-layer node for a non-pseudo layer
     2) there is no pin for an arc
     3) the pins are not composed of pseudo-layers

IMP: Made the "duplicate", "erase", and "move" commands forgiving if locked nodes
     are selected.

IMP: Ability to give primitives an alternate grab point by setting the
     "prototype_center" variable on them.  Modified "dbtechi.c:tech_doaddportsandvars()"
     to recognize a special variable name and instead create the offsets.  Also
     modified technology editor to use "Facet-Center" primitive in main example
     as a way to locate the grab point.

IMP: Converted dialog system in "usrdialogs.c" to a unified model that works 
     in multiple applications.

IMP: Cross-library facet copying now copies all facets that are referenced in
     NODEPROTO variables.  Fixed "usrnet.c:us_copyrecursively()" to find these
     variables and fixed "dbnoproto.c:db_copyxlibvars()" to copy them.  Also,
     "copynodeproto()" adjusts all pointers to NODEINST variables so that they
     stay local to the current facet.  Fixed "dbnoproto.c:db_copyxlibvars()".

BUG: Technology conversion does not set port state bits properly.
FIX: Instead of copying entire "userbits" after "newportproto()" calls, the code
     in "usrctech.c" now copies only the STATEBITS part.

IMP: Fixed GDS input and output to conform to new unit sizes.  Done at Queens.

IMP: Updated Verilog output module to conform to Cadence version 1.6.  Renamed
     module from "simverlog.c" to "simverilog.c".  Work done at Queens.

IMP: Technology editor now has command to edit next node/arc/layer in sequence.
     Technology editor now has command to identify ports in node.
     Technology editor now has a sequence of library dependencies.

IMP: Increased precision of rotation mathematics.  Had "mult()" shift results 30
     places after multiplication.  Changed definition of "P1" and "N1" in "dbmath.c"
     to shift 30, not 16.  Changed use of "sine()" and "cosine()" in
     "iocifout.c:io_cifwritefacet()" to be:
	rx = ((cosine(i)>>14) * 100) >> 16;   ry = ((sine(i)>>14) * 100) >> 16;
     Shift results by 24, not 8, in "dbmath.c:intersect()".
     Divide by 1073741824, not 65535 in "dbmath.c:arcconnects().

IMP: The short checker (drcflat.c) now checks for transistors that touch each
     other through another transistor.  When three are spaced at a minimum,
     the two end ones are unconnected, but their active area may be too close.
     The routine "drcflat.c:drc_transistor_hack()" checks for this situation
     and shortens the active regions.

IMP: Made primitives be lockable.  New bit in NODEPROTO->userbits is "LOCKEDPRIM".
     If set in technology, and us_aid->aidstate&NOPRIMCHANGES is set, primitive
     cannot be moved.  Changes to "conlay.c", "usrcomcd.c", "usrdiacom1.c", and the
     technology editor.

IMP: Schematic transistors are flipped during layout-to-schematic conversion
     to make connections look better.  Change is in transistor placement code
     of "usrctech.c:us_tran_logmakenodes()".

BUG: MAC/GI rotate commands fail.
FIX: Adjust for new internal rotation units in "macmenus.mac".

BUG: Non-MAC pulldown menus don't work if, after opening a menu and a submenu,
     the cursor is moved to the menubar to select a different menu.
FIX: The "quitline" cases 1 and 2 must test for the cursor in the menubar in
     "usrmenu.c:us_pmeachdown()".

BUG: Submenus of pulldown menus cannot have command-key equivalents.
FIX: Must recursively track these in "usrcomln.c:us_menu()".

BUG: Non-MAC pulldown menus fail if they are pushed up by the screen bottom
FIX: Must remember amount shifted up when bottom is detected.  Save this in
     "usrmenu.c:POPUPINST->yshift".  Then in "usrmenu.c:us_popupmenu()" the line:
	if (us_pmcur.posy < 0) us_pmcur.posy = 0;
     becomes:
	if (us_pmcur.posy < 0)
	{
	    us_pmcur.yshift = -us_pmcur.posy;
	    us_pmcur.posy = 0;
	}
    and case statements 1 and 2 at the end of "usrmenu.c:us_pmeachdown()" change:
	if (y <= maxy+2 && y >= maxy-us_pmcur.txthei-2) break;
     to:
	if (y <= maxy-us_pmcur.yshift+2 &&
	    y >= maxy-us_pmcur.yshift-us_pmcur.txthei-2) break;

IMP: Made "grid on/off" when window scales be informative.

IMP: Added ability to describe numbers in "microns", "inches", "centimeters", and
     "half-millimicrons" in addition to the scalable "lambda".  The
     "TECHNOLOGY->userbits" field has the style to use for the technology.
     Extra field in technology editor's miscellaneous "factors" facet.
     Modified "dbtext.c:atola()" and "dbtext.c:latoa()".  "Lambda" command now
     takes keywords in place of lambda values.  GI dialog now has buttons for
     different units.

IMP: Added the constant ELDBUNITS to "global.h" which gives the number of
     database units per micron (currently 2000).

BUG: Changing a facet's view could corrupt the database if there are multiple versions
     of that view.
FIX: In "dbnoproto.c:changefacetview()", calls are made to "db_retractnodeproto()"
     before the view change and to "db_insertnodeproto()" after the view change.  Also,
     the change is not done through "setval()" but rather directly, and the entire
     operation is no longer undoable.

BUG: ESIM, RSIM, RNL, and SPICE have incorrect size and area calculations due to the
     new database unit size.
FIX: In "simsim.c()" and "simspice.c", scale the results of "transistorsize()" when
     they are written as micron values (lengths used to be scaled by 100 and areas
     used to be scaled as 10000; now the values are 2000 and 4000000).

IMP: Ability to write encapsulated PostScript with "tellaid io postscript encapsulated"
     From Queen's University.

IMP: Added cursor "delta" information to simulation window.

BUG: Version 4 libraries are not read properly and need "Debug Check".
FIX: In "io.c:io_fixnewlib()", called "db_scaletechnology" before updating
     values, and also called "setshrinkvalue()" on each arc.

BUG: X11 arcs are not drawn right.
FIX: In "graphx11.c:us_drawcirclearc()", scale the results of all calls to
     "figureangle()" by a factor of 10.

IMP: Updated code in "tecncmos3.c" to look more clean.

BUG: VHDL generation leaves blanks where there are no connections.
FIX: The word "open" is now placed there.

************************* Version 5.00c: Completed 12/30/91 *************************

IMP: Removed requirement that 68881/68882 floating point unit be available on
     the Macintosh (so it can run on a Mac IIsi).

IMP: Added code in "usr.c:us_killobject()" to detect layer deletion in technology
     editing and issue warnings if that layer is still being used.

BUG: Technology editor may create MOS transistors that always fail in DRC.
FIX: To ensure that the diffusion ports align properly, in
     "usredtecp.c:us_tecedmakenodes()", after the lines:
	if (pol2port != 0 && pol2port != 2)
	{
	    if (dif1port != 1 && dif1port != 3)
		us_tecedswapports(&pol2port, &dif1port, tlist); else

	    tlist->portlist[dif2port].highxmul*tlist->xsize + tlist->portlist[dif2port].highxsum) / 2;
	y1pos = (tlist->portlist[dif1port].lowymul*tlist->ysize + tlist->portlist[dif1port].lowysum +
	    tlist->portlist[dif1port].highymul*tlist->ysize + tlist->portlist[dif1port].highysum) / 2;
	y2pos = (tlist->portlist[dif2port].lowymul*tlist->ysize + tlist->portlist[dif2port].lowysum +
	    tlist->portlist[dif2port].highymul*tlist->ysize + tlist->portlist[dif2port].highysum) / 2;
	if (abs(x1pos-x2pos) > abs(y1pos-y2pos))
	{
	    if (x1pos < x2pos)
	    {
		j = dif1port;   dif1port = dif2port;   dif2port = j;
	    }
	} else
	{
	    if (y1pos < y2pos)

	}

************************* Version 5.00b: Completed 12/16/91 *************************

IMP: Database check now looks for invalid NODEPROTO pointers in variables.

IMP: Rotation is now stored in tenth-degrees rather than degrees.

BUG: Only two decimal places are shown to the right of the point.
FIX: In "dbtext.c:latoa()" three are now displayed.

BUG: When dialog windows are moved on the Mac, the currently selected scroll item
     is drawn incorrectly.
FIX: In "usrdialogs.c:tty_redrawdialogwindow()", remove the "#ifndef MACOS/#endif" pair.

BUG: The "Variables..." dialog cannot examine array variables.
FIX: In "usrdiacom2.c:tty_variablesdlog()", change the lines:
	if (strcmp(name, varname) == 0)
	{
	    tty_varestablish(var->addr, var->type&VTYPE, varname);
	    break;
	}

	    } else tty_varestablish(var->addr, var->type&VTYPE, varname);
	    break;
	}


************************* Version 5.00a: Completed 11/28/91 *************************

IMP: Made the "rename" command more intelligent about conflicts.

     standard libraries.

IMP: Added ability to include "trailer file" to SPICE.

IMP: The command "show ports" ("list exported ports" in the graphical interface)
     checks for associativity between icon and contents.

BUG: When moving menu without resizing, entries may get reassigned.
FIX: In "usrmenu.c:us_setmenusize()", change the lines:
	if (*str != 0 && namesamen(str, "getproto", 8) == 0)
	{
	    for(; i<x*y; i++) temp[i] = "command=getproto";
	}
    to:
    	if (i < x*y && *str != 0 && namesamen(str, "getproto", 8) == 0)
	{
	    for(; i<x*y; i++) temp[i] = "command=getproto";
	} else last = NOSTRING;

BUG: Double-clicking to move interactively has unwanted side-effects on the
     Graphical Interface on the SUN.
FIX: The left button is now the standard interactive move, control-left is
     the old style "find".

BUG: Ports in the Artwork technology may have unstable locations.
FIX: Changed their descriptions from OPENED to FILLED.

BUG: Too many calls to infinite string package in "xopen()" and "db_realname()" may
     cause string loss.
FIX: Removed calls to package in "db_realname()" and "xopen()".

IMP: Scaled the basic unit by 20, changing it from the centimicron to the
     half-millimicron.

BUG: In text libraries, there is no association of lambda with technology names
     so rearrangement of technologies in Electric can cause bogus lambda values.
FIX: In "iotext.c", additional code added to write technology names.

************************* Version 4.08c: Completed 11/15/91 *************************

IMP: Fixed "mocmos2" technology to have proper Poly2 port sizes, have a poly2Cut
     node, and have proper Poly2 names.

IMP: Technology editor now stores layer, arc, and node orders and uses them if
     they exist.  Menu commands display the orderings for editing.

BUG: When text is selected on a rotated object, it snaps to another location.
FIX: Changes to "usrtrack.c:us_finddoibegin()" and "usrtrack.c:us_findiup()"

BUG: In technology editor mode, it is not possible to create wires because
     the standard wiring binding (command-click on Macs) has been overloaded to
     make changes.
FIX: Improved "technology edit change" to do wiring if two nodes are selected.

IMP: Made all analog schematic components prompt for information after creation.

IMP: Made schematic MOS transistors use Width/Length instead of the less standard
     order of Length/Width.  Changed "dbtech.c:transistorsize()"

IMP: Removed all calls to 24-bit/32-bit mode switching.

IMP: The VHDL compiler system now properly tracks dates on facets and files.

BUG: When a library has a textual facet as the current one, it is not displayed.
FIX: In "usrcomln.c:us_library()", modified the read code to handle text facets.

BUG: When reading a library with no facets, a crash may occur.
FIX: In "iobinaryi.c:io_doreadlibrary()", change the line:
	lib->firstnodeproto = io_nodeprotolist[0];
     to:
	if (io_nodeprotoindex <= 0) lib->firstnodeproto = NONODEPROTO; else
	    lib->firstnodeproto = io_nodeprotolist[0];

BUG: When drawing into a transistor, the connection is not detected until the
     overlap area is encountered.
FIX: In "usrnet.c:us_getclosest()", change the lines:
	nodesizeoffset(ni->proto, &lx, &ly, &hx, &hy);
	maketruerectpoly(ni->lowx+lx, ni->highx-hx, ni->lowy+ly, ni->highy-hy, poly);
     to:
	maketruerectpoly(ni->lowx, ni->highx, ni->lowy, ni->highy, poly);

BUG: When connecting a multiposition port (AND/OR/XOR) to an arc, the connection
     is made in the center, rather than the next available position.
FIX: In "usrarc.c:us_getnodeonarcinst()", change the call to "portposition()" to:
	if (poly == NOPOLYGON) poly = allocpolygon(1, us_aid->cluster);
	poly->xv[0] = prefx;   poly->yv[0] = prefy;   poly->count = 1;
	shapeportpoly(ni, otherport, poly, 1);
	getcenter(poly, &prefx, &prefy);

BUG: When changing between technologies that have the same size menus (i.e. from
     Analog Schematics to "mocmos2", the menu is not redrawn.
FIX: In "usrmenu.c:us_setmenusize()" change the line:
	if (us_menux == x && us_menuy == y && us_menupos == position) return(0);
     to:
	if (us_menux == x && us_menuy == y && us_menupos == position && allgetproto == 0)
	    return(0);
     And in "usrcomln.c:us_menu()", change the line:
	if (x == us_menux && y == us_menuy && position == us_menupos &&
	    (us_aid->aidstate&MENUON) != 0)
     to:
	if (x == us_menux && y == us_menuy && position == us_menupos &&
	    (us_aid->aidstate&MENUON) != 0 && autoset == 0)
     and change the line
	if (x != us_menux || y != us_menuy || position != us_menupos)
	    (void)us_setmenusize(x, y, position, autoset);
     to:
	if (x != us_menux || y != us_menuy || position != us_menupos || autoset != 0)
	    (void)us_setmenusize(x, y, position, autoset);


BUG: In dialog scroll lists, the bottom line of the enclosing box is sometimes erased.
FIX: In "usrdialogs.c:tty_invertentry()", after the line:
	r.bottom = r.top + tty_lineheight;
     insert the line:
	if (r.bottom >= tty_userrect.bottom) r.bottom = tty_userrect.bottom-1;

BUG: Converting from layout to schematic fails sometimes.
FIX: In "usrctech.c:us_tran_logmakearcs()", change the line:
	bits = us_makearcuserbits(us_apwire->userbits);
     to:
	bits = us_makearcuserbits(us_apwire->userbits) & ~(FIXANG|FIXED);
     and in "usrctech.c:us_convertfacet()", after the call to
     "us_tran_logadjustnodes()", insert the code:
	for(ai = newfacet->firstarcinst; ai != NOARCINST; ai = ai->nextarcinst)
	    if ((figureangle(ai->end[0].xpos, ai->end[0].ypos,
		ai->end[1].xpos, ai->end[1].ypos)%45) == 0) ai->userbits |= FIXANG;

BUG: When a foreign library (CIF, GDS, etc) with no current facet is reread over
     an existing version, a crash may occur.
FIX: In "dblibrary.c:eraselibrary()", after the line:
	lib->firstnodeproto = NONODEPROTO;
     insert the lines:
	lib->curnodeproto = NONODEPROTO;
	for(c = lib->firstcell; c != NOCELL; c = nextc)
	{
	    nextc = c->nextcell;
	    myfree(c->cellname);
	    freecell(c);
	}
	lib->firstcell = NOCELL;

IMP: When dragging a single node, the ports are displayed.
     Changes to "usrtrack.c:us_multidragdraw()".

BUG: On the Mac, the interrupt character will only be detected if it is the first
     key typed during an interruptable process.
FIX: After determining that an event is available, the event is read from the list
     before being evaluated.  Thus, non-interrupt characters will be thrown away.

BUG: On the Mac, resizing the window causes highlighting to go away.
FIX: In "graphmac.c:gra_MyGrowWindow()", added a "SetPort(w)" before the call to
     "InvalRect()".

IMP: Changed "Inverse video" to "Black background" and also added "White background".
     Improved the code to handle these changes even when the current technology
     has no color map.  Also, now choose better colors to accomodate non-Mac
     pulldown menus.

BUG: Pins that wipe when connected to 1 or 2 arcs do not draw properly when the
     connectivity changes.
FIX: In "usrarc.c:runarcinst()", check for "fromnodeinst" or "tonodeinst" having
     "WIPEON1OR2" in their proto's userbits, and if so, do a "startobjectchange"
     before arc creation and an "endobjectchange" after arc creation.  Also, in
     "usrcomek.c:us_erase()" and "usrnet.c:us_erasenodeinst()" made the same
     changes for deleted arcs.  Finally, in "tecschem.c", must declare the Wire_pin
     and the Bus_pin to be WIPEON1OR2.

IMP: Schematic components with special attributes may now have those attributes
     edited in the node's Get Info dialog.

BUG: Binary file output may fail.
FIX: Modified "dbtext.c:xcreate()" to use "wb" for binary formats.

IMP: Now use VLENGTH field of VARIABLE->type to store character offset for
     non-array variables that have "hidden" messages in them (such as
     schematic transistors).  This field is set by "tecschem.c:sch_shapenodepoly"
     and used by "usrhigh.c:us_sethighlight()", "usrnet.c:us_getnodetext()",
     "usrtrack.c:us_finddoibegin()", and "usrdiacom2.c:tty_showdlog()".

IMP: Added "arc toggle" option for reversing state.  Put "Directional" in Mac/GI
     ARC menu.

IMP: Finished memory cleanup in ALS simulator.

************************* Version 4.08b: Completed *************************

IMP: Added a "read argument" to "xopen()" so that binary reading can be specified.

BUG: Macintosh initialization may crash.
FIX: In "usrmisc.c:us_initialbinding()", change the size of the "si" array from 20 to 50.

BUG: In inverse video, many objects are not displayed.
FIX: Many uses of the color BLACK should be changed to MENTXT or MENGLY.

BUG: The network command "tellaid network compare unify-port-names" makes no sense.
FIX: The code, as implemented, prevents reordering of ports during comparison.
     The new command name is "tellaid network compare [not] use-port-sequence".

BUG: Array variables cannot be created "temporary".
FIX: In "usrcomtv.c:us_var()", changed the code:
	if (namesamen(pp, "temporary", l) == 0 && l >= 1)
	{
	    if (index < 0) newtype |= VDONTSAVE;
     to:
	if (namesamen(pp, "temporary", l) == 0 && l >= 1)
	{
	    if (index < 0 || var == NOVARIABLE) newtype |= VDONTSAVE;
     and also did this for the other three cases: "language", "fractional",
     and "cannot-change".

IMP: Modified graphical interface:
     INFO menu: added "Show Tools", removed "Document This Facet"
     ARC menu: added "Reverse"
     COLORS and PATTERNS menu: added "Inverse Video"
     VIEW menu: added "Edit VHDL View" and "Edit Document View".
     VHDL Compiler menu: added "Behavior Library", changed "Place-and-Route"
          to "Silicon Compiler", changed "ALS" to "Simulator"

BUG: Status line at the bottom of the Macintosh display is missing "NODE" and "ARC".
FIX: In "graphmac.c:gra_rearrange[]", change the lines:
	 6, 1, "NODE: ",   18,      2,
	60, 1, "ARC: ",    18,    150,
     to:
	 9, 1, "NODE: ",   18,      2,
	64, 1, "ARC: ",    18,    150,

IMP: Made "Variables..." menu more robust.

IMP: Made ALS simulator more robust when no simulation is in progress.

IMP: Made modifications to convert to THINK_C 5.0 on the Macintosh.
     Split "usrcom.c" into "usrcom1.c" and "usrcom2.c".

IMP: Unified and improved network aquisition code in "vhdl.c" used by ALS
     and QUISC.

FIX: In "usr.c", change the declaration of "us_oldstate" from INT16 to INT32.

BUG: Minimum size polygons in technologies are not handled right.
FIX: In "dbtechi.c:tech_fillpoly()", in the MINBOX code, change the line:
	subrange(ni->lowx, ni->highx, lay->points[8], lay->points[9],
	    lay->points[10], lay->points[13], &minlx, &minhx, lambda);
     to (the "10" becomes a "12"):
	subrange(ni->lowx, ni->highx, lay->points[8], lay->points[9],
	    lay->points[12], lay->points[13], &minlx, &minhx, lambda);

IMP: Added batch DRC from Toronto.  Handles hierarchy but only manhattan geom.

IMP: Added AIDENTRY->aidcap to disable facilities.

BUG: When checking database, facets with no geometry (only text, for example)
     report incorrect R-Tree bounds.
FIX: In "dbgeom.c:geomstructure()", add the line:
	top->lowx = top->highx = top->lowy = top->highy = 0;

BUG: When moving a nonmanhattan arc, the system may get stuck in a loop.
FIX: In "usrnet.c:us_manymove()", change the line:
	if (ni->lowx-ni->temp1 == dx && ni->lowy-ni->temp2 == dy) continue;
     to:
	if (ni->lowx != ni->temp1 || ni->lowy != ni->temp2) continue;

IMP: Made interactive DRC handle nonmanhattan geometry.

IMP: The command "node trace construct-annulus" handles a number of degrees
     of a circle as a fourth argument.

BUG: Undimmed radio buttons do not draw right.
FIX: In "usrdialogs.c:tty_undimitem()" added extra code to redraw button.

IMP: Added ability to move through scroll lists with the up and down arrows
     (modified "usrdialogs.c:tty_getnextcharacter()").

IMP: Added batch design-rule checker (from Mark Moraes) that works hierarchically.

BUG: On Macintosh System 7, cannot switch in and out of 32-bit mode.
FIX: Removed 32-bit code and nuBus memory code.

IMP: Database check now examines "trace" information for validity.

IMP: In network consistency checking, exported ports are considered.  Added
     this as a bit in "netflat.c:net_makepseudo()" and
     "netflat.c:net_buildpseudo()".

BUG: Nonreversible schematic components (Bipolar transistors, diodes, buffers,
     flipflops) can be reversed with no effect on network consistency checking.
FIX: In "netdiff.c:net_diffwirelist()", after the initial test:
	if (p1->wirecount != p2->wirecount) return(1);
     add:
	/* if ports must match in sequence, check is simpler */
	if (p1->function == NPTRANPN || p1->function == NPTRAPNP ||
	    p1->function == NPDIODE || p1->function == NPDIODEZ ||
	    p1->function == NPBUFFER || p1->function == NPFLIPFLOP ||
	    uniport != 0)
	{
	    for(i=0; i<p1->wirecount; i++)
	    {
		if (net_diffwires(p1->pconnlist[i], p1->count[i], p1->negated[i],
		    p2->pconnlist[i], p2->count[i], p2->negated[i], newbuck,
			formerbuck) != 0) return(1);
	    }
	    return(0);
	}

BUG: Negated arcs have no effect on network consistency checking.
FIX: In "netdiff.c:net_diffwires()", add two new INT16 parameters, "f1" and "f2"
     such that the argument list is "n1,c1,f1, n2,c2,f2, ..."  After the test:
	if (c1 != c2) return(1)
     add a new test:
	if (f1 != f2) return(1);
     In each of the calls to "net_diffwires", add the "negated" field, such that
     the argument list:
	p1->pconnlist[i], p1->count[i], p2->pconnlist[j], p2->count[j]
     becomes:
	p1->pconnlist[i], p1->count[i], p1->negated[i],
	    p2->pconnlist[j], p2->count[j], p2->negated[j]

IMP: Added "text read" and "text write" commands to save and restore textual
     facets.

IMP: Added GDS input (from Glen Lawson).

IMP: Added new window type: waveform window.

IMP: Added the "terminal [not] permanent-menu-highlighting" command to allow
     Mac-style highlighting of menus for the duration of the command only.

IMP: Added ability to parameterize nodes used as glyphs in fixed menu entries.
     Changed "usrcomab.c:us_bind()" to allow both "glyph" and "message" options.
     Changed "usrmenu.c:us_drawmenuentry()" to parse the "message" into
     variable options.

IMP: Added ability to switch among multiple editors.  EDITOR structure is
     improved to handle both EMACS and Macintosh.  Editor changes are forced
     out before any Electric command is executed.  Editors can handle window
     resizing during their "redraw" call.

IMP: Added automatic "I-beam" cursor setting on Macintosh.  Removed the command
     "window normal-cursor ibeam"

IMP: Added the command "tellaid silicon-compiler facet-compile" to read the
     netlist from the current facet.

IMP: Changed the "tellaid io debug-toggle" command to
     "tellaid io verbose (on | off | list-facets-read), and use the last option
     in the graphical interface to have facet names listed during input.

IMP: Added a "Show Old Versions" checkbox to the "Old Facet" and the "New
     Facet Instance" commands so that old versions are not displayed unless
     requested.

IMP: Added separate commands for controling polygon merging and cloak layers
     in GDS output: "tellaid io gds output (merge-boxes | individual-boxes)" and
     "tellaid io gds output (include-cloak-layer | ignore-cloak-layer)".  Also
     added ability to place CIF and GDS polygon size limits in the variables
     "IO_cif_polypoints" and "IO_gds_polypoints" on technologies (from Queens).

IMP: Added security checking.  Requires encrypted keys as a variable on
     the user aid.  Encrypts a hostid and includes expiration date and capability.

IMP: Added the VHDL compiler as an aid.  Renamed the "vhdl-compiler" tool to
     be "silicon-compiler".

FIX: In "iogdso.c:io_gds_initialize()" change GDSMULT factor from 1000 to 100.

BUG: MOCMOS Substrate connections may cause SPICE to crash.
FIX: In "simspice.c:sim_spicewritefacet()", just before the call to
     "transistorports()", change the "if" statement to include the case
     "SPICESUBSTRATE".  Thus it will read:
	if (state == SPICEUNKNOWN || state == SPICEMETER ||
	    state == SPICESOURCE || state == SPICESUBSTRATE) continue;

BUG: Macintosh file input may fail.
FIX: In "dbtext.c:xfread()" (the Mac version), change the line:
	for(i=0; i<total; i++) buf[i] = db_tempbuf[i];
     to:
	prod = size * total;
	for(i=0; i<prod; i++) buf[i] = db_tempbuf[i];

BUG: Binary files with swapped bytes may read incorrectly.
FIX: In "iobinaryi.c:io_getin()", change the test "io_swap_bytes != 0" to be
     "io_swap_bytes > 0".

BUG: When a text view of a facet is killed, the edit window does not go away.
FIX: In "usrcomek.c:us_killfacet()", after the call to "us_clearhighlightcount()",
     insert the lines:
	for(w = el_topwindow; w != NOWINDOW; w = w->nextwindow)
	    if (w->curnodeproto == np) (*w->termhandler)(w);
     Also, in "usreditmac.c" and in "usremacs.c", in the routines "us_editorterm()",
     after the block of code that begins with
     "if ((w->state&WINDOWTYPE) == POPTEXTWINDOW)", add the code: 
	else
	{
	    startobjectchange((INT32)w, VWINDOW);
	    (void)setval((INT32)w, VWINDOW, "state",
		(w->state & ~WINDOWTYPE) | DISPWINDOW, VINTEGER);
	    (void)setval((INT32)w, VWINDOW, "buttonhandler", DEFAULTBUTTONHANDLER,
		VADDRESS);
	    (void)setval((INT32)w, VWINDOW, "charhandler", DEFAULTCHARHANDLER,
		VADDRESS);
	    (void)setval((INT32)w, VWINDOW, "changehandler", DEFAULTCHANGEHANDLER,
		VADDRESS);
	    (void)setval((INT32)w, VWINDOW, "termhandler", DEFAULTTERMHANDLER,
		VADDRESS);
	    (void)setval((INT32)w, VWINDOW, "redisphandler", DEFAULTREDISPHANDLER,
		VADDRESS);
	    endobjectchange((INT32)w, VWINDOW);
	}

IMP: Fixed Applicon/860 format reader to handle both tape and disk format,
     to handle byte swapped files, to handle rotated cell instances (did not
     position them correctly), and to work properly (had precision problems).

IMP: Ability to have a procedure variable called "TECH_schematic_conversion"
     on technologies that is used for schematic conversion (from Queens).

************************* Version 4.07g: Completed 5/5/91 *************************

BUG: In the "Variables..." dialog, cannot delete or set a variable on anything
     other than the current object.
FIX: In "usrdiacom.c:tty_variablesdlog()", in the two blocks near the end that
     begin with "if (itemHit == 20)" and "if (itemHit == 18)", change all
     references to "tty_curvaraddr" and "tty_curvartype" to be "tty_varaddr"
     and "tty_vartype".

BUG: Spice extractor crashes when transistor or resistor is unconnected.
FIX: In "simspice.c:sim_spicewritefacet()", after the print of the
     string "AREA=", add the code:
	if (sourcen == NONET || gaten == NONET || drainn == NONET)
	{
	    sim_spice_xprintf(f, "\n");
	    continue;
	}
     In "simspice.c:sim_spice_write_twoport()", just before the line:
	if (end1->netnumber == end2->netnumber)
     insert the word "else"

BUG: When technologies are converted, port characteristics are not preserved.
FIX: In "usrctech.c", each call to "newportproto" must save the result and
     set the "userbits" field from the old port's "userbits" field.

FIX: Removed "cmos4s" technology; removed Applicon 860 and Compactor from G.I.

IMP: Added byte-swapping code to "iobinaryi.c" and "iobinaryo.c" as per Queen's
     University.

IMP: Marked Electric "32-bit clean" for A/UX

BUG: When switching technologies, any changes to the "special" colormap entries
     are lost (i.e. the highlight, grid, etc).
FIX: The routine "usrmisc.c"us_getcolormap()" now has an extra parameter: "reset"
     which indicates whether the entire map is to be loaded, or just the overlappable
     colors.  All technology-switching calls use the new, second option.

IMP: Added code in "usr.c:us_readlibrary()" to handle user-interface attributes
     that have been read-in (especially popup menus) so that the u.i. can be saved.
     On the Mac, there is now "fmacmenus.mac" with the full user interface, and
     "macmenus.mac" which reads the library "muifreeze.txt".

BUG: In Tegas simulation, flipflop type is not detected properly.  Also, in
     "esim/rsim/rnl/cosmos" simulation, generic transistor types are not detected
     properly.
FIX: In "simtexsim.c", convert references to the variable "LOGIC_flipflop_type"
     to use the key "el_schem_flipflop_type" which correctly references the variable
     "SCHEM_flipflop_type".  In "simsim.c", convert references to the variable
     "LOGIC_transistor_type" to use the key "el_schem_transistor_type" which
     correctly references the variable "SCHEM_transistor_type".

BUG: When text editing is terminated with "editfacet" or "outhier", the window is
     not properly terminated and changes may be lost.
FIX: In "usrcomek.c:us_editfacet()" and in "usrcomoq.c:us_outhier()", before the call
     to: "us_clearhighlightcount()", insert the line:
	(*el_curwindow->termhandler)(el_curwindow);

IMP: Added global variables: el_facet_message, el_art_color, el_schem_flipflop_type, and
     el_schem_transistor_type for common variable caching.

IMP: Added the field "viewstate" to VIEW objects, and created two bits: TEXTVIEW for
     views that have pure text in them, and MULTIPAGEVIEW for multipage schematic
     views.  The text views presume a variable "FACET_message" that is the only thing
     in the facet.  Also added three new text views: el_vhdlview, el_netlistview,
     and el_docview.  Added special code in "usrcomek.c:us_editfacet()" to detect
     text views and invoke an editor.

--------------- tell sid about the things above

IMP: Added changes to "simspice.c" as per Queen's University.

IMP: Added code for generic transistors and ARRAY nodes in "dbtech.c" (from
     Queen's University).

BUG: When resizing a popup menu, a crash may occur.
FIX: In "usrcomln.c:us_menu()", change the line:
	for(j=i; j<s; j++)
     to:
	for(j=i; j<s+1; j++)
     And in "usr.c:us_setcommand()", after the first instance of the line:
	for(j=0; j<rb->count; j++) myfree(rb->word[j]);
     add the line:
	rb->count = 0;

BUG: When a "fixed angle" arc is flipped, its angle changes by 180 degrees and
     a jog is inserted unnecessarily.  Also, zero-length arcs should not have
     their angle checked.
FIX: In "conlay.c:cla_domovearcinst()", change the lines:
	if ((ai->userbits&FIXANG) == 0 ||
	    ((ai->userbits&FIXED) != 0 && ai->changed != cla_changeclock-1) ||
		((ai->userbits&AANGLE) >> AANGLESH) == figureangle(fx, fy, tx, ty))
     to:
	if ((ai->userbits&FIXANG) == 0 ||
	    ((ai->userbits&FIXED) != 0 && ai->changed != cla_changeclock-1) ||
		(fx == tx && fy == ty) ||
		    ((ai->userbits&AANGLE) >> AANGLESH)%180 ==
			figureangle(fx, fy, tx, ty)%180)

IMP: Added code in "usrcomtv.c:us_view()" to prevent abbreviations of the form
     "Pnumber" when not creating a multipage schematic view.

BUG: The command "find interactive" may select objects that are half-lambda
     away from the cursor.
FIX: In "usrtrack.c:us_finddoibegin()", do not call "gridalign" before the call
     to "us_findobject()".

IMP: In dialogs, check boxes are highlighted during selection.

IMP: Added "find within vertex interactive" to select and move a trace point.
     Added this to the graphical interface.  Also added rotation and mirroring
     about the vertex to the graphical interface.

BUG: When a single click is made for the "find interactive" command and there
     is nothing under the cursor, many random objects are selected.
FIX: In "usrtrack.c:us_finddoibegin()", change the lines:
	us_dragox = xcur;   us_dragoy = ycur;
	us_dragx = 1;   us_dragy = 1;
	maketruerectpoly(xcur, xcur+us_dragx, ycur, ycur+us_dragy, us_dragpoly);
     to:
	us_dragx = us_dragox = xcur;   us_dragy = us_dragoy = ycur;
	maketruerectpoly(xcur, xcur, ycur, ycur, us_dragpoly);

IMP: Added the "show environment authors" command to list those who helped.
     Also added the list to the "About" dialog.  Display this dialog in the
     Non-Mac graphical interface.

IMP: Graphical interface "Get Info" on nodes now displays position as the highlighted
     corner, not the actual corner.

IMP: When icons are automatically generated, all ports are set to be always-displayed
     so that they can be seen when expanded.

BUG: On SUNs, the status window is ruined when dialogs pop up.
FIX: Change the variable named "tty_firstline"  to "tty_topline" in "usrdialogs.c".

IMP: Added variable "FACET_schematic_page_size" to NODEPROTOs to specify the
     size of a schematic page frame.  Any facet can have this (multipage facets
     default to having one).  No longer a SCHEMWINDOW attribute on windows.  New
     command: "view frame" gets and sets the frame size.

IMP: To allow both backspace and delete keys to work, changed
     "usrdialogs.c:tty_modaldialog()" to handle both.

IMP: For Macintosh System 7, changed "macinter.c:mac_systemfoldername()" to look for
     "Preferences" folder and removed the offset of 64 in the "TextMode" call in
     "graphmac.c:gra_stringput()".

IMP: Added a "well" item to the schematic technology (from Queens).

NEW: Added the module "simspicerun.c" to handle execution and plotting.

BUG: Automatic network unification is done upon request or in schematic facets.
     However, if the user forgets to declare the facet {sch} and places
     schematics, the network maintainer does not unify.
FIX: In "network.c", all tests for the schematic facet type also check the
     technology.
     
IMP: Artwork primitives that are drawn in the menu now use the menu glyph color
     (changed "usrmenu.c:us_drawmenuentry()" to fake the "ART_color" variable).

IMP: No longer draws ports that are off the screen when part of a facet instance
     is visible.  In "usrdisp.c:us_makeprotopoly()", after the line:
	sx = us_makescreenx(px, w);   sy = us_makescreeny(py, w);
     add the line:
	if (sx < portcliplx || sx > portcliphx || sy < portcliply || sy > portcliphy)
	    return(NOPOLYGON);

BUG: When screen is redrawn, facets may shrink.
FIX: In "graphXXX.c", changed calls to "us_drawmenu(1)" to "us_drawmenu(0)".

IMP: Added ability to set color of popup menu and dialog text and graphics.  Also
     made Facet-Center primitive use soft colors.

BUG: When connecting schematic wires (or any wires not intended to be Manhattan)
     an extra pin may be created.
FIX: In "usrarc.c:us_directarcinst()", change the call to "arcconnects()" so that
     the first argument is "i", not "ang".

BUG: When rigid arc connects two nodes and one is rotated nonmanhattan, arc is
     converted to zigzag.
FIX: In "conlay.c:cla_domovearcinst()", change the line:
	if (fx == tx || fy == ty || (ai->userbits&FIXANG) == 0)
     to:
	if ((ai->userbits&FIXANG) == 0 ||
	    ((ai->userbits&FIXED) != 0 && ai->changed != cla_changeclock-1) ||
		((ai->userbits&AANGLE) >> AANGLESH) == figureangle(fx, fy, tx, ty))

BUG: When editing technology color maps, the "Reset" button ruins the map.
FIX: The color mixer now saves the initial map and has a "Cancel" button which
     restores those settings.

BUG: Cannot change the state of a stipple dot in technology editing of layers.
FIX: In "usredtecc.c:us_teceditmodobject()", the LAYERPATTERN case must be called
     separately so that it does not push/clear/pop the highlighting.  Then, in
     "usredtecc.c:us_tecedlayerpattern()", remove the call to "us_getonehighlight()"
     and make "high" a HIGHLIGHT (not HIGHLIGHT *) and load it fully before calling
     "us_addhighlight()".

BUG: PostScript output doesn't plot correctly.
FIX: In the file "iopsout.c", search for the incorrectly spelled keyword
     "StringLenght" and correct it to "StringLength".

BUG: Unexpanded instances that are rotated nonManhattan are drawn incorrectly.
FIX: In "usrdisp.c:us_drawnodeinst()", after the call to "maketruerectpoly"
     which follows the comment: "get facet rectangle and determine screen clipping..."
     insert the line "poly->style = CLOSEDRECT".

BUG: Crash may occur when adding technologies.
FIX: In "dbtech.c:registertechnologycache()", change the list insertion order
     so that new routines go at the start (replace the code after the comment
     "put this object at the start" so that it reads:
     "rl->nextroutinelist = tech_firstcache;   tech_firstcache = rl;"

IMP: Network improvements from Burnie West: handles reverse order busses
     (i.e. BUS[7:0]); handles icons better; does bus highlighting better.

BUG: Arcs generated by technology conversion to schematics may have wrong
     characteristics (i.e. negating bubbles set).  Also, arcs created with
     iconification have the same problem.
FIX: Created the routine "usrnet.c:us_makearcuserbits()" to convert from ARCPROTO
     usrbits to ARCINST usrbits.  Use this routine in "usrarc.c:runarcinst()",
     "usrctech.c:us_tran_logmakearcs()", and "usrnet.c:us_makeiconfacet()".

BUG: Window deletion may work incorrectly.
FIX: All three calls to "us_killcurrentwindow" in the module "usr.c" should have
     the argument "1" in them.

IMP: Added BODYONLY as a bit in ports to request that the port not appear in icons.
     Added the option "port export|change ... body-only".

************************* Version 4.07f: Completed 1/21/91 *************************

BUG: May bomb out on null commands or unbound keys.
FIX: In "usrparse.c:us_makecommand()", change the "if" statement from "count < 0"
     to "count <= 0".

BUG: The command "node trace" bombs out.
FIX: Added test for proper "count" in "construct-annulus" case.

BUG: Cannot do command completion on the path "/"
FIX: Rewrote "beginsearch" in "dbtext.c".

IMP: Added "variable ... fractional" to set fractional attributes.  Use it in
     graphical macro packages, which corrects bug in "Describe this Facet".

IMP: Added drop-shadows to popup and pulldown menus.

BUG: When rotating a transposed node to a specified angle, result is incorrect.
FIX: In "usrcomrs.c:us_rotate()", in the block of coded headed by the comment
     /* rotate nodes */, after the line:
	amt = (atoi(par[0]) - ni->rotation) % 360;
     add the line:
	if (ni->transpose != 0) amt = -amt;

IMP: Converted Macintosh to GWORLD.

************************* Version 4.07e: Completed 12/26/90 *************************

IMP: Removed three obsolete technologies: nnmos, ncmos, and micmos.

BUG: The command "var textedit" may display an incorrect value.
FIX: Must save the variable in "usrcomtv.c:us_var()" because the call to
     "us_makeeditor()" will destroy it.

BUG: When changing an attribute on a PORTPROTO, crashes may occur.
FIX: In "dbvars.c:db_whichlibrary()", change the VPORTPROTO case to be:
	np = ((PORTPROTO *)addr)->parent;
	if (np->index == 0) return(np->cell->lib); else return(NOLIBRARY);
     And in "dbvars.c:db_whichcluster()", change the VPORTPROTO case to be:
	np = ((PORTPROTO *)addr)->parent;
	if (np->index == 0) return(np->cell->cluster); else return(np->tech->cluster);

BUG: Roundoff errors occurred in CIF generation when using the "centered" option.
FIX: Changes to "iocifout.c" from CMC.

BUG: Rotations in CIF files with large numbers cause instability on input.
FIX: Updated "iocifin.c:io_rotatelayer()" from CMC.

************************* Version 4.07d: Completed 12/20/90 *************************

IMP: Changed DRC to retain highlighting of errors (in pointout mode).

IMP: Made the Facet-Center primitive NOT SELECTABLE unless the "port" option is OFF.

BUG: GDS output did not handle rotated polygons properly.
FIX: Changes to "iogds.c" from CMC.

IMP: Added QUISC 2 from CMC.  Old QUISC modules now begin with "sc1" and new
     ones are "sc".

BUG: Popup menus may crash.
FIX: In "usr.c:us_newvariable()", near the end, just before the call to the
     routine "us_parsebinding()", insert the line:
	mi[i-1].value = 0;

IMP: Added ability to superscript and subscript in PostScript output by using
     "\d" and "\u" to start, "\}" to finish (from Chris Schneider, University
     of Manitoba).

IMP: Corrected the CMOS4s technology as per instructions from Russ Wright.

IMP: Added "menu setmenubar" command on all systems.

BUG: When arraying a primitive that has been scaled to a nonstandard size, the
     overlap distances are based on the standard size.
FIX: In "usrcomab.c:array()", change the line:
	xform(np->highx-np->lowx - plx - phx, np->highy-np->lowy - ply - phy,
	    &xoverlap, &yoverlap, trans);
     to:
	xform(ni->highx-ni->lowx - plx - phx, ni->highy-ni->lowy - ply - phy,
	    &xoverlap, &yoverlap, trans);

BUG: The name "xflush" conflicts with some system namespace.
FIX: Changed all references to "xflush" to "xflushbuf".

IMP: New "graphx11.c" module from Sid Penstone at Queen's University (includes
     improvements from Ken Stevens at HP Labs).  Supports DECWindows.

IMP: Added the database routines "isdirectory()", which tells whether a file
     is a directory or a plain file, and "currentdirectory()", which returns the
     full path name of the current directory.

IMP: Added the routine "us_movesavedbox()" to all "graphXXX" modules to move the
     position of a saved box upon restore.  This is used by the dialogs code.

IMP: Created the modules "usrdialogs.c" to implement Macintosh-like dialogs
     on all systems.  Also created "usrdiacom.c" with dialog controllers for
     most important functions.  Added the command "terminal [not] display-dialogs"
     to switch use of these.

************************* Version 4.07c: Completed 10/2/90 *************************

************************* Version 4.07b: Completed 10/1/90 *************************

BUG: Network identification in switch-level simulators doesn't work.
FIX: In "sim.c:sim_set()", change the line:
	case COSMOS: return(sim_simpointout(par[1]), var->addr);
     to:
	case COSMOS: return(sim_simpointout(par[1], var->addr));

MAC: Fixed technology editor so that "TEXT" entry prompts for message.

************************* Version 4.07a: Completed 9/25/90 *************************

BUG: There is no way to place Splines in primitives in technology edit.
FIX: Removed "circle-spline" shape option in technology editor.

IMP: Improved "dbmath.c:reduceportpoly()" to handle DISCs properly.

BUG: When new nodes are created, their location may not be exactly at the cursor.
FIX: In "dbmath.c:corneroffset()", change the line "hy = np->highy - hy - cx;"
     to "hy = np->highy - hy - cy;" (the "cx" becomes "cy").

IMP: Forced ".txt" files to have a correct library name taken from the disk
     file and WITHOUT the ".txt".

BUG: If a node has more than one exported port and the facet is skeletonized, the
     node is included multiple times in the skeleton.
FIX: Must track nodes that have been created in the skeleton facet (fixed
     "usrcomcd.c:us_copyfacet()").

IMP: Fixed revision date tracking so that temporary variables do not update the
     date (changed "dbchange.c:db_change()").  Also moved date copying code in
     "dbnoproto.c:copynodeproto()" to the end of the routine.

BUG: When multiple things are highlighted, "window peek" bombs.
FIX: In "usrcomtv.c:us_window()", added the line "if (high == NOHIGHLIGHT) return;"
     after the call to "us_getonehighlight()" in the "peek" code.

MAC: Removed call to "flushscreen()" at last line of "usrwindow.c:us_endchanges()".

IMP: New command: "tellaid network like-named-nets [unify-always |
     unify-only-in-schematics]" unifies commonly named nets only in schematics
     unless requested.

MAC: Can now request SPICE parasitics

MAC: Now accepts Control key shift on buttons.

IMP: Removed "drcgram.c" from the list of active modules.

MAC: Now accepts ESCAPE and Command-. as the Cancel button in dialogs.

BUG: Very large contacts do not display the multiple cuts.
FIX: In "dbtech.c:nodepolys()", in the MULTICUT case, there is debugging code
     to prevent more than 100 polygons from being displayed.  Remove this code.

BUG: File input of very large libraries may fail.
FIX: In "iobinaryi.c:io_doreadlibrary()", change the declaration of the local
     variables "i" and "this" from INT16 to INT32.

IMP: Strings that are assigned don't always work on all machines (particularly
     HP!).  Changed assigned strings in "tecschem.c" (the strings in the polygons),
     "usrcomtv.c" (the null strings), "tecgem.c" (the strings in the polygons).

IMP: Added assembly code for HP9000 models 300 and 800 (PA-RISC).

IMP: Added "-f" switch to X Window support to use full screen.  Requires
     code in "graphx11.c" and ignoring "-f" switch in "usr.c:us_options()".

BUG: Switch-level simulation of very large circuits may write bad decks.
FIX: In "simsim.c:sim_makenodename()" change the declaration of the formal
     parameter "node" from INT16 to INT32; and in "simsim.c:sim_prop()"
     change the declaration of the formal parameter "index" similarly.

IMP: When converting from layout to schematics, transistor sizes are displayed
     if they are nonstandard.

BUG: When an old version of a cell is written in CIF, the semicolon in the
     facet name causes a syntax error.
FIX: In "iocifout.c:io_cifwritefacet()" changed "describenodeproto(np)" to
     "np->cell->cellname".

IMP: Changed TECH_NODES->xsize, TECH_NODES->ysize, TECH_ARCS->arcwidth, and
     TECH_ARCLAY->off from INT16 to INT32 to accomodate very large primitives.

IMP: Added the "-c" switch to the command line (at startup) to ignore the
     ".cadrc" file (from Queen's University).

MAC: Removed the New Arc command from the ARC menu (Command-K) and now use
     Command-click to do all arc creation.

MAC: If two objects are selected (with click and Option-click) then Get Info
     reports their distance.

MAC: Added ability to record and playback sessions on Macintosh.

BUG: The session log is not flushed on normal program termination.
FIX: In "usr.c:us_done()", added call to "us_logfinishrecord()" before call
     to "us_termgraphics()".

IMP: Made the Manhattan constraint actually be a "fixed angle" constraint.
     Requires vast changes:
      > Changed "MANHAT" to "FIXANG" and "WANTMAN" to "WANTFIXANG" in the database.
      > Added the "arc fixed-angle", "arc not fixed-angle",
        "defarc XXX fixed-angle" and "defarc XXX not fixed-angle" commands (kept
        the "manhattan" commands for compatibility).
      > Changed the "tellaid pla nmos manhattan" command to "fixedangle"
      > Changed arc highlighting in "conlay.c" so that fixed-angle arcs
        display an "F".
      > in "conlay.c:cla_modflex()" new code exists after the special-case
        vertical and horizontal code that handles the general case.  Calls
        on the new routine: "cla_nonorthogmanhat()".
     Internal changes to be consistent with this:
      > Added the routine "dbmath.c:arcconnects()" to determine where two
        ports can connect to an arc of a given angle.
      > in "usrcheck.c:us_checklibrary()", removed the code that checks for
        valid manhattan constraints.
      > In "dbnoproto.c:replacenodeinst()", changes to code that detects
        whether a newly reconnected arc on a replaced node should be zig-zaged
        or is still "manhattan".
      > In "usrctech.c:us_tran_logmakearcs()", manhattan bit is only turned
        off for new schematic arcs if the arc is not at a 45 degree increment.
      > In "usrarc.c:runarcinst()", removed the restriction that manhattan arcs
        must be orthogonal upon creation.
      > In "usrarc.c:us_directarcinst()", use call to arcconnects() to check angles.
      > In "usrarc.c:us_getnodeonarcinst()", only turn off manhattan bits on
        split arcs when the two halves are now at different angles.
     There is now a default angle on ARCPROTOS:
      > Added "defarc XXX angle ANGLEINC" to define this angle increment.
      > Added "Angle increment" field in technology editing.
      > Added AANGLEINC and AANGLEINCSH fields to ARCPROTO->userbits, changed
        technologies to include this field.
      > Added option to leave the ANGLE field off of the "create angle" and
        "create join-angle" commands.  The arcproto default is used.  Also allow
	"create angle" to be used when two objects are highlighted and arc creation
	is to be done.
      > The routine "usrarc.c:aconnect()" now takes an additional parameter
        which is the angle increment desired for arcs.
      > Modified the technology editor to have new field in arc facets.

IMP: Put facet locking directly into "conlay.c" by preventing node motion
     if a facet instance and locked.

BUG: When unexpanded facet instances are moved, and their port names extend
     beyond the instance bounds, the text is not erased properly.
FIX: Modified "usrdisp.c:us_makeprotopoly()" to take clipping bounds (now passed
     by "us_writeprotoname()" and "us_drawnodeinst()") and move the port text
     to within the facet instance bounds.

MAC: Changed many "toggle" menu entries to actually use check marks.

MAC: Changed "Join" command in Windows menu to "Delete".

MAC: Added little crosses every 10 grid dots on Macintosh.

BUG: The command "find interactive ANGLE" tracks along ANGLE degree increments
     but does not lock to those radials when the move is actually made.
FIX: In "usrtrack.c:us_findiup()", the "us_dragstate == 0" case should have
     the code: "us_getslide(us_dragangle, us_dragox, us_dragoy, xcur, ycur,
        &xcur, &ycur);" after the "gridalign()" call.

BUG: On Black&White displays, the current window partition is not highlighted.
FIX: In "usrdisp.c:us_drawwindow()", added special code to detect raster
     displays being highlighted, similar to the code in
     "usrhigh.c:us_highlightmenu()".

BUG: In technology edit, when a text field is selected and modified, the
     highlighting becomes incorrect.
FIX: In "usredtecc.c:us_teceditmodobject()", the highlighting must be saved
     and restored properly.

IMP: Added ability of technology editor to place circular arc graphics in
     primitives.

NEW: Added Bipolar technology from Burnie West, Schlumberger ATE.
     Removed old "i2l" from standard distribution.

IMP: Fixed technology editor so that pins appear first and pure-layer nodes
     appear last.

BUG: When alias files are used, file descriptors may fill up.
FIX: In "dbtext.c:db_realname()" there should be a "xclose(f)" before the
     final return.

IMP: Added test in "usredtecp.c:us_tecedmakeprim()" to make sure that multi-cut
     layers are opaque.

IMP: Added "node trace construct-annulus INSIDE OUTSIDE [SEGMENTS]" command to
     create an annular structure from the currently highlighted pure-layer node.

IMP: Added "window join" command to do the reverse of "window kill", merge the
     current window with the other, deleting the other rather than this.

IMP: Changed "usrhigh.c:us_highlightverbose()" so that zero-width arcs have
     their verbose highlighting letters displayed off of the line.

MAC: Modified "graphmac.c" to handle black&white displays.

************************* Version 4.06e: Completed 7/1/90 *************************

IMP: Added "dbnoproto.c:layoutview()" to get the facet that is the layout view.

BUG: On the Macintosh, the Yes/No dialogs and the DRC error dialog may abort
     the command for no reason.
FIX: The "cancel" button sets an abort request, but these dialogs have no
     such button.  They must save and restore the abort request "el_pleasestop".

BUG: When command completion is done on a line whose total prompt and response
     length are wider than the status window, a crash occurs.
FIX: This happens in "terminal.c" and "macterminal.c" because the arrays "pa_ttyline"
     and "pa_ambiguous" are only as wide as "us_lastcol" and so they overflow.
     Added a new variable "pa_truelength" to record the current buffer size.
     Also added the routine "tty_expandbuffers()" to expand buffers when they are
     out of space.  Checks are made in "tty_startinput()" and "pa_getword()".

IMP: New nodes in "ncmos3" technology, new SPICE header for that and "cmos4s".

IMP: Added "tellaid io cif output not-centered" to describe CIF boxes
     from their corner.  From Queens.

IMP: Added "tellaid simulation spice" commands: "[not] use_nodenames" and
     "format [2|3|hspice]".  Removed "parse-spice3-output".  From Queens.

IMP: Took latest "simspice.c" from Queen's university 4.05

************************* Version 4.06d: Completed 6/10/90 *************************

IMP: When a node with trace information scales, its trace does too.  Changed
     "usrcomrs.c:us_size()" and added the routine "usrmisc.c:us_scaletraceinfo()".

IMP: Fixed "iopsout.c" so that it uses character tables rather than image methods
     to print overlapping stipple patterns. (from Penstone).

IMP: Changed layer tables in "tecncmos3.c" according to Sid Penstone

IMP: Added ability to rotate and mirror "about-trace-point" for polygonal primitives.
     If a trace point is highlighted, uses that, otherwise uses the first.
     Changed "usrcomrs.c:us_rotate()", "usrcomln.c:us_mirror()", and "usrcom.c".

IMP: When Yanking, do not copy the facet center primitives.  Changed
     "usrnet.c:us_yankonenode()".

************************* Version 4.06c: Completed 5/12/90 *************************

BUG: GDS output is incorrect for transposed and rotated geometry.
FIX: In iogds.c:io_outputgdspoly(), change the line:
	if (angle != 0) xformpoly(poly2,trans);
     To be:
	xformpoly(poly2,trans);

************************* Version 4.06b: Completed 4/24/90 *************************

BUG: Nodes that are transposed and nonmanhattan do not appear correctly.
FIX: In dbmath.c:makeangle(), change the declaration of "i" from INT16 to INT32.

IMP: Added option to rotate and mirror about grab point "rotate about-grab-point".

IMP: When cursor off screen and is needed for command, error message printed.

MAC: Allow spaces in library names on Macintosh.


************************* Version 4.06a: Completed 4/18/90 *************************

BUG: When "peek"ing into a facet instance that is not of type contents (i.e.
     skeleton), nothing is displayed.
FIX: In usrdisp.c:us_drawall, remove the "contents" switching code:
	onp = contentsview(subnt);
	if (onp != NONODEPROTO)
	{
	    subnt = onp;
	    corneroffset(ni, ni->proto, ni->rotation, ni->transpose, &bx, &by);
	    corneroffset(NONODEINST, subnt, ni->rotation, ni->transpose, &cx, &cy);
	    transid(localtrans);
	    localtrans[2][0] = ((bx - cx)*2 + ni->highx + ni->lowx -
		subnt->lowx - subnt->highx) / 2;
	    localtrans[2][1] = ((by - cy)*2 + ni->highy + ni->lowy -
		subnt->lowy - subnt->highy) / 2;
	} else

BUG: When converting technologies, change is issued during broadcast.
FIX: In usr.c:us_newobject, in the VNODEPROTO case, change the us_setnodeproto call
     to be us_shadownodeproto instead.

BUG: Geometry is not properly detected (specifically, auto-stitching fails).
FIX: In dbmath.c:getbbox, the bounding box may have low and high values reversed.
     The code:
	*lx = poly->xv[0];
	*hx = poly->xv[1];
	*ly = poly->yv[0];
	*hy = poly->yv[1];
     should be:
	*lx = mini(poly->xv[0], poly->xv[1]);
	*hx = maxi(poly->xv[0], poly->xv[1]);
	*ly = mini(poly->yv[0], poly->yv[1]);
	*hy = maxi(poly->yv[0], poly->yv[1]);

BUG: Color map files may be incorrectly generated.
FIX: In usrcomcd.c:us_color, the "write" option has a loop from 0 to 256 that writes the
     color values.  After the assignment of "j" in that loop, insert the line:
	if (j < ' ' || j >= 0177) j = ' ';

BUG: Unification of power and ground in the network tool does not take effect.
FIX: In network.c:net_newvariable, the line (near the beginning):
	if (key == net_connect_power_groundkey && (type&VTYPE) == VNETWORK &&
     should be:
	if (key == net_connect_power_groundkey && (type&VTYPE) == VAID &&

BUG: The command "tellaid network name-connections" does not work properly.
FIX: In network.c:net_set, the "name-connections" option must always print a node that
     is nonprimitive.

************************* Version 4.04: Completed *************************

BUG: When switching to a newly created technology on the Macintosh, arcs are no longer
     drawn Manhattan.
FIX: In the startup macro package macmenus.mac add the line:
	var set f 90
     as the first line in the macro pmtesetup (insert this line after the line which reads:
     macbegin pmtesetup no-execute).

BUG: The technology editor can create transistors that do not pass DRC.
FIX: The code for decomposing transistors into their electrical layers is incorrect.
     In usredtecp.c:us_tecedmakenodes(), change the line
	if (serprule[1] - serprule[5] > serprule[3] - serprule[7])
     to the lines:
	if (tlist->xsize - serprule[1] + serprule[5] <
	    tlist->ysize - serprule[3] + serprule[7])

BUG: Popping the highlight stack when nothing is highlighted may cause a bomb.
FIX: The code for usrhigh.c:us_pophighlighted() must save the address in the variable
     for the highlight stack and use that address, rather than depending on the variable
     var, since the call to us_setmultiplehighlight() may trash the variable.

BUG: The "window peek" command fails when over rotated/transposed facet instances.
FIX: The code for dbmath.c:makerotI() incorrectly uses the node prototype when it should
     be using the instance.  Change all references from np to ni.  Also, the peek code
     in usrdisp.c:us_drawall() is modified to use makerotI(), and the swapping of bounding
     boxes is now done with a 32-bit integer (i is only 16 bits).

BUG: There is some question as to whether the ability to select a facet instance's name is
     useful.  Although it is nice to be able to move the text, it's selection generally
     conflicts with the selection of the actual facet instance.
FIX: Have the facet instance text only selectable with special "find" options, specifically,
     only when the "port" option is NOT used.  To do this, however, requires some work.
     (1) The findport variable in usrcomek.c:us_find() must be passed to us_findobject()
     (as the parameter after findanother != NOHIGHLIGHT) and the us_dragfport variable
     used as the extra parameter (second from last) in the us_findobject() call in
     usrtrack.c:us_finddoibegin().  (2) This new parameter to us_findobject() must then be
     passed to the call to us_recursivelysearch() (as the parameter after another) and the
     two recursive calls to us_recursivelysearch() inside of the routine must also include
     the parameter.  (3) This new parameter to us_recursivelysearch() must now be passed to
     us_checkoutobject() (also after the another parameter) at all six invocations.  (4) This
     new parameter to us_checkoutobject() must be included in the call to initnodetext() as
     the second parameter.  (5) Inside of initnodetext(), the first line must be changed from:
	us_nodearcvarptr = us_nodenameflg = 0;
     to:
	us_nodearcvarptr = 0;
	if (findport == 0) us_nodenameflg = 0; else us_nodenameflg = 1;
     where findport is the new parameter, finally passed to the code that needs it.  The
     Macintosh now requires a special select to get facet names.  The line:
	bind set button osbutton find extra-info interactive
     appended to the macmenus.mac file sets the OPTION-SHIFT button to be able to select
     facet names.

BUG: When an area is selected which cuts an arc, and then a move command is given, both
     end points (ie. even the unselected one) move.  It would be very convenient if it
     were not the case so that a "plough" could be implemented.
FIX: When an area is selected for a move, use only the nodes in the area.  To do this,
     in usrcomln.c:us_move(), move the lines:
	/* get the objects to be moved */
	list = us_gethighlighted(OBJNODEINST | OBJARCINST);
     up before the comment:
	/* see if a text object is highlighted */
     And then after the lines:
	if ((high.status&HIGHTYPE) == HIGHTEXT)
	{
	    us_movetext(&high, count, par);
	    return;
	}
     add the lines:
	if ((high.status&HIGHTYPE) == HIGHBBOX)
	    list = us_gethighlighted(OBJNODEINST);

BUG: The node expand code makes suspicious use of TEMPFLG without setting it.
FIX: In usrnet.c:us_doexpand(), remove the first conditional and its block structure.
     Also change the line:
	ni->userbits |= (NEXPAND|TEMPFLG);
     to:
	ni->userbits |= NEXPAND;
     The routine now begins:
	if ((ni->userbits & NEXPAND) == 0)
	{
	    startobjectchange((INT32)ni, VNODEINST);
	    ni->userbits |= NEXPAND;
	    endobjectchange((INT32)ni, VNODEINST);
	    if (++sofar >= amount) return;
	}
     finally, since TEMPFLG is used nowhere else, the other two references to it should be
     removed.   In usr.h, remove the define of TEMPFLG, and in usrwindow.c:us_endchanges(),
     remove the only mention of TEMPFLG.

BUG: Crashes when reading EDIF libraries
FIX: In ioedifi.c:io_edif_parameter(), in the K_PORT case, insert the line:
	pp->subnodeinst = NONODEINST;
     after the line:
	io_edif_portlist = pp;
     And in usrnet.c:us_makeiconfacet(), change the block of code after the comment:
	/* determine type of pin */
     to be:
	pintype = pinproto;
	wiretype = wireproto;
	if (pp->subnodeinst != NONODEINST)
	{
	    bpp = pp;
	    while (bpp->subnodeinst->proto->index == 0) bpp = bpp->subportproto;
	    if (bpp->subnodeinst->proto == buspproto)
	    {
		pintype = buspproto;
		wiretype = busproto;
	    }
	}

BUG: When making an array of primitives, their overlap may be incorrect.
FIX: In usrcomab.c:us_array(), define:
	INT32 plx, ply, phx, phy;
     and replace the line:
	xform(np->highx-np->lowx, np->highy-np->lowy,
	    &xoverlap, &yoverlap, trans);
     with the lines:
	nodesizeoffset(np, &plx, &ply, &phx, &phy);
	xform(np->highx-np->lowx - plx - phx,
	    np->highy-np->lowy - ply - phy, &xoverlap, &yoverlap, trans);

BUG: When an exported bus pin is multiply connected, the network becomes inconsistent
     (doesn't pass debug check due to buslinkcount errors).
FIX: In network.c, make the routine net_namenet() an INT16 and have it return: zero at
     the first return (after the allocstring() call), one at the second call (after the
     namesame() call), zero at the third call (after the mymalloc() call), and zero at
     the end of the routine.  Then, in net_addnametonet(), change the first call and
     its subsequent statement from:
	net_namenet(netname, newnetwork);
	net_ensurebusses(newnetwork, count, strings, indices);
     to:
	if (net_namenet(netname, newnetwork) == 0)
	    net_ensurebusses(newnetwork, count, strings, indices);
     and make all other calls be (void).  Also, in net_mergenet(), before the comment:
	/* replace arc references to the old network with the new one */
     insert the code:
	if (oldnet->signals > 1) for(i=0; i<oldnet->signals; i++)
	    oldnet->networklist[i]->buslinkcount++;

BUG: When a bus pin is exported but not connected to any bus arcs, the network merges
     with non-bus arcs on the pin
FIX: In network.c:net_pconnect(), after the line:
	if (pi->proto->network == pp->subportproto->network)
     add this code:
	/* do not follow bus pins onto non-bus arcs */
	if (pp->subnodeinst->proto == net_bus_pin &&
	    pi->conarcinst->proto != net_bus_wire) continue;
     (thus it is the first line inside of the first "for" loop)

BUG: When deleting a network name that is used elsewhere, the network is deletederroneously.
FIX: In network.c:net_killvariable(), delete the call to net_unnamenet().  Also remove
     the subroutine.  Replace the call with this code:
	/* if this network is at all complex, must renumber facet */
	if (ai->network->namecount != 1 || ai->network->arccount != 1 ||
	    ai->network->portcount != 0 || ai->network->buslinkcount != 0)
	{
	    net_recursivelymarkabove(ai->parent);
	    return;
	}

BUG: When a bus pin is connected to a wire pin, network checking produces spurious errors.
FIX: In network.c:net_nconnect(), comment out the first call to net_checkvalidconnection()
     and place this code at the end of the routine (before the return(recheck);):
	/* now check that this wire connects properly to bus pins */
	for(i=0; i<2; i++)
	{
	    ni = ai->end[i].nodeinst;
	    if (ni->proto == net_bus_pin && ai->proto != net_bus_wire)
	    net_checkvalidconnection(ni, ai);
	}

BUG: When converting technology MOCMOS to a library, too many highlights and ports appear.
FIX: In usredtecg.c:us_tecedmakelibfromtech(), just BEFORE the comment:
	/* create the highlight node */
     add the line:
	if (first != 0) continue;

BUG: Problem in VHDL compiler's routing.
FIX: In scroute.c:Sc_route_channel_assign(), change the line:
	if (direct == SCPORTDIRUP) {
     to be:
	if ( (direct & SCPORTDIRUP) && !(direct & SCPORTDIRDOWN) ) {
     and change the line:
	if (direct == SCPORTDIRDOWN) {
     to be:
	if ( (direct & SCPORTDIRDOWN) && !(direct & SCPORTDIRUP) ) {
     and in scroute.c:Sc_route_decide_exports(), change the lines:
	/* check for bottom row */
	if (chport->port->node->row->number == 0) {
     to be:
	/* check for bottom channel */
	if (chport->node->channel->number == 0) {
     and change the lines:
	/* check for top row */
	if (chport->port->node->row->number == 
	    (cell->placement->num_rows - 1) ) {
     to be:
	/* check for top channel */
	if (chport->node->channel->number == 
	    cell->placement->num_rows) {

BUG: Unbinding of popup menu entries fails.
FIX: In usrcomab.c:us_bind(), the un-binding code, after the comment:
	/* handle un-binding */
     must be changed so that the call:
	(void)setindkey((INT32)us_aid, VAID, varkey, index, (INT32)"");
     becomes:
	(void)initinfstr();
	if (popup != 0)
	{
	if (popup < 0) (void)addstringtoinfstr("inputpopup="); else
	    (void)addstringtoinfstr("popup=");
	(void)addstringtoinfstr(popname);
	(void)addtoinfstr(' ');
	}
	(void)addstringtoinfstr("command=");
	(void)setindkey((INT32)us_aid, VAID, varkey, index,
	(INT32)returninfstr());

BUG: Facet undrawing doesn't get all layers.
FIX: In usrdisp.c:us_drawnodeinst() and in usrcomtz.c:us_window() change
     all mention of us_efacet to be us_ebox.

BUG: Fixed menu commands that need cursor location work wrong.
FIX: In usr.c:us_ontablet(), insert the line:
	us_state &= ~GOTXY;
     Before the call to us_execute().

BUG: Cell ports not drawn properly.
FIX: In usrdisp.c:us_makeprotopoly(), the lines:
	transcpy(subrot, prevtrans);
	transmult(localtran, prevtrans, subrot);
     should be:
	transcpy(subrot, temptr);
	transmult(localtran, temptr, subrot);
     and the lines (note: two such line sets, this one tests "rpp"):
	if ((w->state&PORTLABELS) != PORTSCROSS &&
	     (rpp->textdescript&(VTXOFF|VTYOFF)) != 0)
     should be:
	if ((w->state&PORTLABELS) != PORTSCROSS &&
	     ni->proto->index == 0 && (rpp->textdescript&(VTXOFF|VTYOFF)) != 0)

BUG: Textured curved lines not drawn properly.
FIX: In tecart.c:art_shapearcpoly(), the line:
	if (realwid == 0) switch (ai->proto->index)
     should be:
	if (realwid == 0 && poly->style != CIRCLEARC) switch (ai->proto->index)

BUG: Linear inequality constraints not stored properly.
FIX: In conlin.h, the declaration of LINCON->value should be INT32, not INT16.

BUG: Floating point variables not handled right in text format files.
FIX: In iotext.c:io_decode(), changed the VFLOAT case to return(castint(atof(name)))

BUG: In arc creation, connections that should be direct are drawn with intermediate pins.
FIX: In usrarc.c:makearcinst(), try to route directly before trying two-bend.

BUG: The "move" and "duplicate" commands do not use facet center information.
FIX: Add these lines:
	/* special case when moving one node: account for facet center */
	if (total == 1 && list[1] == NOGEOM)
	{
	    ni = nodelist[0];
	    corneroffset(ni, ni->proto, ni->rotation, ni->transpose, &lx, &ly);
	    bestlx = ni->lowx + lx;
	    bestly = ni->lowy + ly;
	}
     before the call to us_clearhighlightcount() in usrcomcd.c:us_duplicate() and  before
     the call to us_pushhighlight() in usrcomln.c:us_move().

BUG: MOSIS CMOS cannot read generalized CIF descriptions.
FIX: In  tecmocmos.c:mocmos_setmode(), added the lines:
	mocmos_cif_layers[LSELECTPP] = "";
	mocmos_cif_layers[LSELECTNP] = "";
	mocmos_cif_layers[LWELLPP] = "";
	mocmos_cif_layers[LWELLNP] = "";
     before the call to mocmos_setpseudo() in the "general-process" case, and added the lines:
	mocmos_cif_layers[LSELECTPP] = "CSP";
	mocmos_cif_layers[LSELECTNP] = "CSN";
	mocmos_cif_layers[LWELLPP] = "CWP";
	mocmos_cif_layers[LWELLNP] = "CWN";
     before the call to mocmos_setpseudo() in the "either-process" case.

BUG: Bomb out during "esim", "rsim", "rnl" or "mossim" deck generation if symbolic
     transistors are used.
FIX: In simsim.c, there is an incorrect call to getval() that should be a call to
     getvalkey().  The arguments are: (INT32)ni, VNODEINST, VSTRING, schem_transistor_type.

BUG: Line intersection produces incorrect results.
FIX: Fix the numerical instability in dbmath.c:intersect() so that a/b/c is swapped if
     abs(a1) < abs(a2), not if a1 == 0.

BUG: Cannot write technology libraries in text format because NODEPROTO variables with
     the value NONODEPROTO are not handled properly.
FIX: Extra code in the VNODEPROTO case of iotext.c:io_decode() and iotext.c:io_makestringvar().

BUG: Program crashes after about 20 minutes of intensive work due to error in the routine
     initinfstr().
FIX: In the file dbtext.c, change the declarations db_infstrstackbase, db_infstrstackpos,
     and db_infstrdeepeststack from INT16 to INT32.

BUG: Variables placed on port instances cause crash (this is not done in normal use).
FIX: In the module dbvars.c, make two changes to each of the routines db_whichcluster(),
     db_whichnodeproto(), and db_whichlibrary() (thus, make six changes).  The first change
     is in case VPORTARCINST, where the word proto must be changed to the word conarcinst.
     The second change is in case VPORTEXPINST where the word proto must be changed to the
     word exportproto.

BUG: Color map editing in the technology editor crashes.
FIX: In the module usredtecc.c, routine us_teceditcolormap(), the line of code that reads
     myfree(layerlabel[i]) should be changed to myfree(layerabbrev[i]).

BUG: Changes to the color map during technology editing cause random colormap changes.
FIX: In the module usredtecc.c, routine us_edtecmaptermhandler(), move the call to
     (*us_edtecoldtermhandler)(w) from last line to the first line.

BUG: Color map editing makes incorrect access to data structures (this bug is not known
     to manifest itself in any way, but should be fixed).
FIX: In the module usrpallet.c, routine us_palette(), the line of code that begins with
     us_lettermap[i] should end with the expression ((INT32 *)varletter->addr)[i] rather
     than ((INT32 *)varletter)[i].

BUG: Crashes during command completion on file names in nonexistent directories.
FIX: In the module dbtext.c, routine nextfile(), change the line of code
    free((char *)db_filenamelist); to be
    if (db_filecount == 0) free((char *)db_filenamelist);

BUG: In the MOSIS CMOS technology, polygonal S-transistors are incorrectly defined.
FIX: In the module tecmocmos.c, the structures mocmos_tpa_l and mocmos_tpaE_l should be
     changed so that the line beginning with LWELLNP ends with the constants K7, K7, K4,
     not K7, K8, K4.

BUG: The "undo" command allows the "broadcast-now" option but cannot execute it.
FIX: This option is no longer supported.  Remove the line with "broadcast-now" in usrcom.c.

NEW: Added COSMOS simulator interface to simsim.c.

NEW: Added macterminal.c, macdialogs.c, usreditmac.c, and macinter.c to handle specific
     Macintosh code.

NEW: Added SALT simulator interface to simsalt.c.

NEW: Added TEGAS simulator interface to simtexsim.c.

NEW: Added SILOS simulator interface to simsilos.c.

NEW: Added generic simulator interface to simgeneric.c.

NEW: Added "L" output module, iolout.c, and modified io.h, io.c, usrcom.c, and usrcomln.c.

NEW: Since access to time information is complex and system dependent, a new module, etime.h,
     was created and is included by ioedifo.c, ioplot.c, sc.c, simcadat.c, simsim.c,
     simverlog.c, usrcomcd.c, usrcomek.c, usrcomrs.c, and usrstatus.c.

NEW: Created the module data.c for all global variables that used to be declared in headerfiles.

IMP: Added option to redraw all windows but not the menus or status "redraw windows".

IMP: Added option to specify coordinates to "node trace add-point" and "node trace
     move-point".

IMP: Changed AIDENTRY->aidstate from INT16 to INT32 and changed setval() calls in
     dbcontrol.c, usrcomcd.c, usrcomln.c, and usrcomtz.c.

IMP: Added the routine ttyputmsgf() so that factual messages can be supressed.

IMP: Added the routine ttygetfullparam() to distinguish multiple-keyword input.

IMP: Improved usr.c:us_setcommand() to allow message changes while unbinding.

IMP: Invalid initial libraries now print error but do not exit (changed usr.c:us_do3init()).

IMP: Menu text is never larger than 12 points in usrmenu.c:us_popupmenu().

IMP: dbcontrol.c:stopping() returns value and el_pleasestop need not be tested.

IMP: Fixed ordering of ports on SPICE subcircuit calls as per Burnie West

IMP: Updated COSMOS simulation as per Ken Stevens

IMP: Added the constant TXTEDITOR to graphics.h for fixed-width editor font.  Modified
     usremacs.c to use it, and all "graph" modules to respond to it in the us_settextsize()
     routine.

IMP: Improved "debug check" command so that arcs not in their ports are adjusted in Manhattan
     ways if possible.

IMP: It makes more sense for the NAMEVARS->ptr entry to be INT32*, not INT32.  This change
     is in dbvars.c.

IMP: In usr.c:us_do3init(), changed null message to error() so that it explains situation.

IMP: Changed hypot() calls to computedistance() in iocifin.c:io_outputwire(),
     iocifpars.c:io_iwire(), and iocifpars.c:io_rotate().

IMP: Added proper declarations for these INT32 routines: dblibrary.c:db_muldivq(),
     dbmath.c:db_sqrt(), dbtechi.c:tech_extendfactor(), iobinaryi.c:io_arrangeaidbits(),
     iocifout.c:io_cifbloat(), iogds.c:io_gds_open_file(), placngrid.c:plac_nmos_init_rows(),
     placutils.c:plac_init_bits(), usrarc.c:us_widestarc(), usrarc.c:us_portdistance(),
     usrmisc.c:us_alignvalue(), usrmisc.c:us_setdescriptoffset(), usrmisc.c:us_gettextposition().

IMP: Added the declaration INT16 us_pmeachdown(); to the routine usrmenu.c:us_pmeachchar().

IMP: In order to make usremacs.c more portable, the control characters in quotes were
     replaced with octal constants.

IMP: The global errno is an int, not an INT32 (in simspice.c).

IMP: Fixed Lucid Lisp interface (minor bug fixes, added tellaid1).

IMP: Improved drc.c:dr_check() to keep highlighting in pointout mode when "?" is typed.

IMP: Improved X11 driver, graphx11.c so that (1) color map loading in us_loadmap() is done
     all at once, (2) entry 255 of map is inverted in us_loadmap(), thus allowing area
     inversion to work, (3) arc drawing works right in us_drawcirclearc(), and (4) A/UX
     systems have 1-button mouse.

IMP: Improved color map mixing in usrpallet.c to handle 1-button mouse better.

IMP: Modified usrmisc.c to initialize 1-button mouse properly.

IMP: Fixed bug in technology editor so that text can be included in primitives (improved
     usredtecp.c).

IMP: Fixed bug in technology editor where polygonally defined nodes, when rotated, don't
     appear rotated in the primitive (fixed usredtecp.c:us_tecedmakeprim() to use makerot() calls).

IMP: In global.h, created aux  switch to define A/UX and added "-Daux" to makefile.  Combined
     the aux switch with the hpux switch to produce a new switch, systemV , for UNIX System V.

IMP: Changed aux variable use in dbmerge.c.

IMP: Changed usrstatus.c:us_preventloss() and dbcontrol.c:db_bombout_error() so that they do
     not use the "7" character to generate a beep, but rather call ttyputerr().

IMP: To save space, changed the value of MINRTNODESIZE in global.h from 20 to 4.

====================== Macintosh ======================

MAC: As an interim bug fix for MPW 3.0, the REGISTER declarations were removed from the
     routine usrdisp.c:us_redisplaynow(), and two lines were rewritten in
     usrhigh.c:us_highlighteverywhere().

MAC: In global.h, added conditionals to define MACOS on any Macintosh. 

MAC: Added proper Macintosh names to config.h.

MAC: Added Macintosh initialization to langno.c:main().

MAC: Added the module UNIX.c to give the VHDL compiler a proper  interface.

MAC: Fixed sc.c and scsim.c to use getline() instead of fgets() and to use xeof() instead of
     feof().

MAC: Added xcreate(), xappend(), xclose(), xflush(), xeof(), xseek(), xprintf(), xgetc(),
     xungetc(), xputc(), xfread(), xfwrite() to dbtext.c.

MAC: Default simulation state is "dontrun" (in sim.c:sim_init()).

MAC: Since "comp" is a reserved word in MPW, must change the local variable to something else
     ("compo") in conlingtt.c and conlinprs.c.

MAC: Since there is no stty() call and no soft erase/kill characters, code is changed in the
     modules usr.h and terminal.c.

MAC: Added "menu setmenubar" command in usrcom.c and usrcomln.c.

MAC: Since there is no subprocess capability, the "system" command cannot be implemented and
     code is removed in usrcomrs.c:us_system().  Also, code is removed in sc.c, sim.c,
     simsim.c, simspice.c, and drcflat.c.

MAC: Due to the single-user nature of the Macintosh, the "help news" command is not be
     supported and code is removed in usrcomek.c:us_help().

MAC: Changed iobinaryo.c:io_writebinlibrary() to avoid file renaming and to set binary file types.

MAC: Changed directory-parsing code in dbtext.c.  Also, dbtext.c:xopen() is patched.

MAC: Modified dbcontrol.c so that bringdown() uses ExitToShell() and error() uses Alert().

MAC: Modified dbmult.c and dbmulta.s.c to include Macintosh assembly code.

MAC: Changed config.h so that DOCDIR and LIBDIR are variables (el_docdir and el_libdir) which
     are initialized in langno.c.  These variables are then used in dbtext.c, iobinaryi.c,
     iotext.c, simsim.c, usr.c, usrcomcd.c, usrcomek.c, and usrcomrs.c.

    Improved "dbvars.c:db_copyxlibvars()" and "dbnoproto.c:copynodeproto()"
	to report failures of variable copying when crossing libraries

	overlaps multiple unconnected ports, it is not associated with either
	(multiple changes to "usredtecp.c:us_tecedmakenodes()")
    Improved wired-port size calculations to be more forgiving of nodes
	with severe width offsets (in "dbmath.c:reduceportpoly()" changed
	min/max calculations to use "bx/ux/by/uy" rather than "cx/cy")
    Changed PL_HEADER->magic to a 32-bit integer in "ioplot.h" and rebuilt
	"splot" to work right
    Fixed bug in technology converting (from layout to schematics) that created
	subfacets of the wrong size (in "usrctech.c:us_convertfacet()", added
	the line "(*el_curconstraint->solve)();" after the call to
	"us_tran_logadjustnodes(newfacet);")
    Fixed bug node deletion that caused error if node had arc connected to
	itself (in "usrnet.c:us_erasenodeinst()" added the line
	"if ((pi->conarcinst->userbits&DEADA) != 0) continue;"
	after the third code line, "npi = pi->nextportarcinst;")

	have characteristics but other example does, transfer of the information
	does not work (in "usredtecp.c:us_tecedmakeprim()", changed the line:
	"(void)setval((INT32)ns->node, VNODEINST, "EDTEC_connects", var2->addr,
	VNODEPROTO|VISARRAY);" to be "(void)setval((INT32)ns->node, VNODEINST,
	"EDTEC_connects", var2->addr, VNODEPROTO|VISARRAY|(getlength(var2)<<
	VLENGTHSH));")
    Improved technology editing to detect unassociated conditions better
	(added code in "usredtecp.c:us_tecedassociateexamples()")

	incorrect highlight bounds (improved "usredtecp.c:us_tecedmakenodes()"
	at the end where node size offset is computed)

	technologies are added or deleted
	(in "compact.c:com_buildtechnologies()", changed the 8th line:
	"cur_tech_array = NOTECHARRAY;" to "com_conv_layer = NOTECHARRAY;")

Version 4.00Beta+: Completed May 27, 1988
    Sent to: Queen's University
    Improved "simspice.c" to handle "SIM_SPICE_model" on nodes and use that
	as the subcircuit name.  Also looks for "DC" source nodes to define
	power and ground
    Improved "usrcomab.c:us_bind()" to recognize "getproto" commands even
	when they are macros (i.e. "getproto' has been renamed)
    Improved "dbtext.c:getline()" to return the last line of a file even when
	there is no newline
    Fixed "ioplot.c:io_writeplotlibrary()" so that error is printed when

    Fixed bug in port label offsets so that they shift properly when node rotates
    Improved "dbnoproto.c:contentsview()" to handle unknown views
    Improved numeric stability of "dbmath.c:polydistance()" by changing call to
	"db_sqrt(cx*cx + cy*cy)" to be "computedistance(0, 0, cx, cy)"
    Fixed bug in "usrcomln.c:us_move()" where "move to" moved away (the call
	to "us_manymove()" after the "to" option should have its last two
	parameters read "xcur-bestlx, ycur-bestly")
    Improved "dbchange.c:db_change()" to handle multiple facet size changes
	properly so that undo doesn't make database bad
    Improved "usrparse.c" so that quoted macro parameters are handled right
    Fixed bug in "usrparse.c:us_fleshcommand()" where a macro, invoked while
	another macro is being defined, gets no parameter substitution
	(changed the line: "if (varrunning != NOVARIABLE && (varbuilding ==
	NOVARIABLE || namesame((char *)varrunning->addr,
	(char *)varbuilding->addr) == 0))" so that the last "==" is a "!=")	
    Fixed bug in "usrcomek.c:us_find" where "find within" command bombed out
	if a node was not selected.
    Converted all integers to "INT16" and "INT32" for machine independence
    Fixed bug in "usrcom.c" where "bindgbuttonp" had two "NOBACKUP"s and no
	"NOPARAMS" in it.
    Fixed bug that bombed out if the command "var textedit" used a popup menu
	and was undone (required revamping of "usrcomtz.c:us_var()" and
	"usremacs.c")
    Improved "network.c" to check for wires incorrectly connected to busses
	(name differences)
    Improved "usrcomln.c:us_node()" and "usrcomab.c:us_array()" to shift

	"endobjectchange((int)newno, VNODEINST);")
    Fixed bug that caused exported ports on unconnected nodes to be ignored
	from the network list (in "network.c:net_reevaluatefacet()", changed
	the loop after "finally update connectivity values on unconnected ports"
	comment to read "for(pp = np->firstportproto; pp != NOPORTPROTO;
	pp = pp->nextportproto) if (pp->network == NONETWORK)
	(void)net_pconnect(pp);" ... it used to be a much longer loop).
    Improved "dbgeom.c:boundobj" to detect curved arcs and compute properly
    Fixed bug where selecting an arc twice caused a core dump (added the
	line "lastdirect->fromport = NOPORTPROTO;" after the LAST line
	"lastdirect->fromgeom = geom;" in "usrnet.c:us_checkoutobject()")
    Added HP UNIX conditional compile (should be same as System V)
    Fixed bug in initialization that causes CGRAPH batching sequence errors.
	(in "dbcontrol.c:el_run()", changed the line
	"db_erasebatch(db_curbatch);" to the lines
	"if (db_curbatch->changehead != NOCHANGE) { db_endbatch();
	db_erasebatch(db_curbatch); }".  In "usr.c:us_do3init()", removed
	the call to "us_endchanges(NOWINDOW);")
    Added VERILOG simulation deck output ("simverlog.c")
    Fixed bug in "usrcomrs.c:us_replace()" that didn't redraw nodes and arcs

    Improved "usrcom.c" to handle "next-proto", "prev-proto", "this-proto",
	etc. in "getproto" command

	VNODEINST, VINTEGER|VISARRAY, el_trace) != NOVARIABLE) return;"
	to "dbmath.c:reduceportpoly" before call to "getbbox()").
    Improved technology editor so that it can handle the "MINIMUM SIZE"
	specification on layers, and thus edit the "mocmos" technology.
	Also modified the "mocmos" technology so that it can be edited.
    Fixed bug in technology editor that prevented serpentine transistors
	from being generated properly.  In "usredtecp.c:us_tecedmakenodes()",
	changed the line "tlist->initialbits |= NODESHRINK;" to the line:
	"tlist->initialbits |= (NODESHRINK | HOLDSTRACE);"
    Fixed bug in initialization that causes errors on CGRAPH systems.
	Changed calls to "setvalkey()" so that they call "quietly_setvalkey()"
	in: "io.c:io_init()", "compact.c:com_init()", "rout.c:ro_init()",
	"network.c:net_init()" (two times), "drc.c:dr_init()", and
	"sim.c:sim_init()" (six times).  Must also insert the line
	"net_connect_power_ground = 0;" after the second "quietly_setvalkey()"
	call in "network.c:net_init()".  Finally, must convert the calls
	in "dbtechi.c:tech_doaddportsandvars()" so that "setval()"  becomes
	"quietly_setvalkey" using the name converted to a key with "makekey()".
    Fixed bug in polygon filling on Black&White SUN displays.  Changed the line
	"if (op != 0)" in "graphsun.c:gra_drawpoly()" to be "if (raster == 0)".
    Fixed bug in ordering of initialization.  Moved call to "db_initdatabase"
	from its current location in "dbcontrol.c:el_run()" to a position
	(earlier in the routine) just after the block that loops on "el_maxaid".
	Also changed the declaration "FACET *db_facetfree;" in "database.h"
	to read "CELL *db_cellfree;" and added the line "db_cellfree = NOCELL;"
	in "dbmath.c:db_initdatabase()".
    Added "dbtext.c:describearcproto" to include technology name if not current
    Improved "dbtext.c:describenodeproto" to include library name if
	not in the current library and technology name if not current.
	Also created "dbtext.c:nldescribenodeproto" to supress this information.
    Fixed bug where undoing a shrunk arc makes it not shrunk (rearranged
	"dbchange.c:undolastbatch" so that the call to "db_change" in the
	ARCINSTMOD case occurs AFTER the arc is restored to its old state)
	Also rearranged the NODEINSTMOD case in the same way
    Fixed bug where zero-length arcs become vertical (added the line:
	"if (ai->end[0].xpos == ai->end[1].xpos && ai->end[0].ypos
	== ai->end[1].ypos) return;" as the first line in
	"dbcreate.c:determineangle()")
    Fixed bug in network renumbering that causes infinite loop when a node
	that is both connected and exported is deleted, and then the deletion
	is undone (added "ai->network = NONETWORK;" after "ai = (ARCINST *)addr;"
	and added "pp->network = NONETWORK;" after "pp = (PORTPROTO *)addr;"
	in "network.c:net_newobject()")
    Fixed bug in nonmanhattan arc processing that left "tabs" when an arc
	bends (reified "usr.c:us_modifyarcinst()" so that it calls
	"setshrinkvalue", and rearranged calls to "db_change(...ARCINSTMOD...)"
	in "conlay.c" and "conlin.c" so that changes are made BEFORE call)
    Improved "usrarc.c" to handle directional ports that overlap
    Fixed more processing: removed reset of "tty_linesout" in
	"terminal.c:tty_startinput()"; incremented initialization of
	"tty_linesout" in "terminal.c:ttygetchar()"; added calls to
	"ttymsgok()" before calls to "el_curwindow->charhandler" in
	"usr.c:us_oncommand()"
    Generalized "dbtext.c:describenodeinst()", "dbtext.c:describearcinst()", and
	"dbtext.c:describenodeproto()" to not use fixed-length arrays
    Added "color highlight" command to fade unhighlighted colors

    Improved EMACS editor to accept ESCAPE character as Meta prefix
    Fixed bug in error printing that caused the string OOPS appeared (changed

	((tty_inited&(FULLINIT|PAUSEINIT)) != FULLINIT || (us_gotstatus&DEBTTY)
	!= 0) return;")
    Fixed bug in database where killing all versions of a cell core dumps
	later (added "db_change((unsigned)c,OBJECTNEW,VCELL,0,0,0,0,0);" call
	after "alloccell" call in "dbnoproto.c:newnodeproto"; added "if
	(np->cell->firstincell == NONODEPROTO) (void)db_change(np->cell,
	OBJECTKILL,VCELL,0,0,0,0,0);" after "db_change" call in
	"dbnoproto.c:killnodeproto" to document cell changes; removed code
	that frees cell name and cell in the NODEPROTOKILL option of
	"dbchange.c:db_erasebatch"; added option "case VCELL: cell =
	(CELL *)c->entryaddr;  myfree(cell->cellname); freecell(cell); break;"
	in the OBJECTKILL switch in "dbchange.c:db_erasebatch")
    Fixed bug in menu highlighting that highlighted too many fixed menu entries
	when changing technologies (fixed "usrstatus.c:us_showcurrentnodeproto"
	and "usrstatus.c:us_showcurrentarcproto" to quit if there is no current
	node/arc)
    Fixed bug in And, Or, Xor gate expansion in which they dissapeared
	(added "flush-changes" request to user interface and called it
	from "tecschem.c:sch_shapeportpoly")

	not to repaint (added additional clear of "us_menuchanged" in
	"usr.c:us_startbatch")

	compares of "obj->style" with CIRCLE and DISC to compares of
	"objc->style" in usrwindow.c:us_showthispoly" after call to "us_cliparc")
    Fixed bug in arc clipping (changed the line "*lx = mini(y1,y2) + in->xv[0];"

    Improved Schematic technology to make pins, Power, Source, and Meter square
    Fixed bug in arc clipping that caused "freed block not allocated" error
