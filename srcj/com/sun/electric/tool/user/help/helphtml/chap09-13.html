<!-- PREFERENCE Tools/Placement -->

Electric has a placement tool that can rearrange a circuit so that routing is easier.
The tool can handle schematic or layout cells.
<P>
To run placement, use the <B>Place Current Cell</B> command
(in menu <B>Tools / Placement</B>).
<P>
The Placement Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Placement" tab)
let you control which placement algorithm is being used.
It also lets you control specific preferences for each algorithm.
<P>
These are the possible placement algorithms:
