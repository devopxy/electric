The routing tool contains a number of different subsystems for creating wires.
Two <I>stitching</I> routers can be used in array-based design to connect adjoining cells.
A maze-router runs individual wires.
A river-router is available for running multiple parallel wires.
Finally, the sea-of-gates router handles many wires in arbitrary connection situations.

<TABLE><TR><TD>
All of the non-stitching routers make use of the "Unrouted Arc",
a thin-line arc that can connect any two components.
Creating "rats nests" of these arcs forms a graphical specification that the router can use.
The unrouted arc is from the Generic Technology
(see <A HREF="chap07-06-03.html#chap07-06-03">Section 7-6-3</A>).
To create one, use the <B>Get Unrouted Wire</B> command (in menu <B>Tools / Routing</B>).
Then use standard wiring commands to run the unrouted arc.
Another way to get unrouted wires is to select all or part of an existing route
(made with any arc) and use the <B>Unroute</B> command.

<P>
Another way to get Unrouted arcs for router input is to use the
<B>Copy Routing Topology</B> and <B>Paste Routing Topology</B> commands.
These copy the network topology from one cell (the "copied" cell) to another cell (the "pasted" cell).
The copied cell should be properly routed.
The <B>Paste Routing Topology</B> command uses node and arc names to associate the two cells.

The Routing Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Routing" tab)
controls all of the different routers.
The section in the upper-left applies to the two stitching routers (Mimic and Auto).
Specific sections apply to specific routers
(see <A HREF="chap09-06-03.html#chap09-06-03">Section 9-6-3</A> for the Mimic Stitcher,
<A HREF="chap09-06-02.html#chap09-06-02">Section 9-6-2</A> for the Auto Stitcher, and
<A HREF="chap09-06-06.html#chap09-06-06">Section 9-6-6</A> for the Sea-of-Gates router).
