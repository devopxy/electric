<!-- HEADER 1-4: Building Electric from Source Code -->

It is not necessary to rebuild Electric from the source code because the downloads are ready to run.
For people who wish to explore the source code, this section describes some of the necessary steps.
<P>
The first step in building the source code is to extract it from the ".jar" file.
To do this, place the ".jar" file in its own directory, change to that directory, and run the following command:
<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jar xf electric-<I>version</I>.jar</CODE>
<BR>
(Windows users may want to install "cygwin," from <A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com">www.cygwin.com</A>,
in order to more easily run "jar" and other commands.)
The "jar" command will create a number of files and folders on your disk:
<UL>
<LI><B>com</B> is a folder with all of the source code.</LI>
<LI><B>packaging</B> is a folder with support files for building Electric.</LI>
<LI><B>META-INF</B> is a support folder used when running the ".jar" file and can be deleted.</LI>
<LI><B>build.xml</B> is an Ant script for building Electric.</LI>
<LI><B>ChangeLog.txt</B> is a detailed list of changes to Electric.</LI>
<LI><B>COPYING.txt</B> is the GNU copyright document that applies to your use of Electric.</LI>
<LI><B>README.txt</B> is a file of notes about Electric.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Electric source code is also available from the GNU Savannah repository with one of these commands:
<BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;svn co svn://svn.savannah.gnu.org/electric/trunk<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;svn co http://svn.savannah.gnu.org/electric/trunk</CODE><BR>
which will extract the code into the current directory (preferably a clean directory with nothing else in it).
<P>
The next step is to get a version of Java that can build source code.
Although a "JRE" (Java Runtime Environment) is sufficient for running Electric,
it is not able to build the source code.
For that, you must have a "JDK" (Java Development Kit).
In addition, you may want to use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as
NetBeans (at <A HREF="http://www.netbeans.org">www.netbeans.org</A>) or
Eclipse (at <A HREF="http://www.eclipse.org">www.eclipse.org</A>).
<P>
<H4>Running under Eclipse</H4>
<P>
Here are some notes about building Electric under Eclipse:
<UL>
<LI><B>Setup Workspace.</B>  The Workspace is a point in the file system where all source code can be found.
You can use the directory where you extracted the Electric source code, or any point above that.</LI>
<LI><B>Create Project.</B> The Project defines a single program that is being built.
Use <B>New Project</B> under the <B>File</B> menu and choose "Java Project".
Choose "Create project from existing source" and browse to the folder where the files were extracted.
Give the project a name, for example, "Electric."</LI>
<LI><B>Configure Source Code.</B> The "Source" tab of the Eclipse project settings shows the files that were discovered.
Make sure that the extracted directory is included (along with everything else under it).</LI>
<LI><B>Configure Libraries.</B> The "Libraries" tab of the Eclipse project settings lets you add other packages that may be relevant to the build.
There are no required libraries, but many optional ones
(see <A HREF="chap01-05.html#chap01-05">Section 1-5</A> on plug-ins).
Use the "Add External JARs" button to add any extra libraries.</LI>
<LI><B>Handle Macintosh variations.</B>
If you are building on a Macintosh, no changes are needed.
If you are not building on a Macintosh, you must decide whether or not you want the code that you produce to
also run on a Macintosh.
If you do not care about being able to run on a Macintosh, remove the source code module
"com.sun.electric.tool.user.MacOSXInterface.java" (which probably has a red "X" next to it indicating that there
are errors in the file).
If you want the final code to be able to run on all platforms,
download the stub package "AppleJavaExtensions.jar" from
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/AppleJavaExtensions">
developer.apple.com/samplecode/AppleJavaExtensions</A>
and add this as an external JAR file.</LI>
<LI><B>Run Electric.</B> Use the <B>Run...</B> command (under the <B>Run</B> menu)
to create a run configuration.
Under the "Main" tab of the run-configuration dialog,
give the configuration a name (for example, "Electric"),
set the Project to match the one that you have created,
and set the "Main class" to be "com.sun.electric.Launcher".
Under the "Arguments" section of the dialog,
it is a good idea to increase Electric's memory size by entering "-mx1000m" under "VM arguments".</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H4>Running under Netbeans</H4>
<P>
The best way to use Netbeans is to extract the source code from the Savannah repository, as described above.
If you do this, you will have a directory called "trunk".
The first step is to add the Bean Shell to the build,
which can be done by changing to the "trunk" directory and running the "make" command.
<P>
Next start Netbeans and open the "electric-netbeans" project that is in the "trunk" folder.
You should be able to build the man project (under the "Run" menu)and then run or debug the main project.
<P>
<H4>Using Ant</H4>
<P>
"Ant" is a scripting system for building Java programs,
and Electric comes with an Ant script file called "build.xml".
Once the source code is extracted, you can build Electric simply by typing Ant commands.
The Ant target "runFromBin" will build and run Electric.
The Ant target "jarForGNUBinary" will build a new ".jar" file from the source code.
<P>
Note that when using Ant, there are some Macintosh vs. non-Macintosh issues to consider.
<UL>
<LI><B>Build on a Macintosh</B>
The easiest thing to do is to remove references to "AppleJavaExtensions.jar" from the Ant script.
This package is a collection of "stubs" to replace Macintosh functions that are unavailable elsewhere.
You can also build a native "App" by running the Ant target "mac-app".
Macintosh computers must be running OS 10.3 or later.
</LI>
<LI><B>Build on non-Macintosh</B>
If you are building Electric on and for a non-Macintosh platform,
remove references to "AppleJavaExtensions.jar" from the Ant script.
Also, remove the module "com.sun.electric.MacOSXInterface.java".
It is sufficient to delete this module, because Electric automatically
detects its presence and is able to run without it.</LI>
<LI><B>Build on non-Macintosh, to run on all platforms</B>
To build Electric so that it can run on all platforms, Macintosh and other,
you will need to keep the module "com.sun.electric.MacOSXInterface.java".
However, in order to build it, you will need the stub package "AppleJavaExtensions.jar".
The package can be downloaded from Apple at
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/AppleJavaExtensions">
developer.apple.com/samplecode/AppleJavaExtensions</A>.</LI>
