There are three built-in design-rule checkers: <I>incremental</I>, <I>hierarchical</I>,
and <I>schematic</I>.
<P>
The incremental design-rule checker is always running, examining your layout,
and issuing error messages when an error is detected.
It checks only the current cell, and does not consider the contents of cell instances,
lower in the hierarchy.
It therefore offers an instant analysis, but not a complete one.
<P>
The hierarchical design-rule checker uses the same rules and techniques as the incremental checker,
but it checks all levels of hierarchy below the current cell.
To run it, use the <B>Check Hierarchically</B> command (in menu <B>Tools / DRC</B>).
To check only a selected subset of the current cell, use <B>Check Selection Hierarchically</B>.
<P>
The schematic design-rule checker looks for issues that make drawing or editing of the cell difficult.
These are the errors that is finds:
<OL>
  <LI>Nodes:
    <UL>
      <LI>Nodes whose parameters don't match the cell definition (check export names, units, and visibility).</LI>
      <LI>"Stranded" pins: with no connections, exports, or attached text.</LI>
      <LI>"Inline" pins: those that sit in a line between two arcs (both of which could be replaced by a single straight arc).</LI>
      <LI>Nodes whose ports touch but are not connected.</LI>
      <LI>Invisible pins with text that is offset from the node center (this is an internal consistency check).</LI>
      <LI>Nodes whose names are the same as network names in the cell.</LI>
      <LI>Schematic exports whose characteristics are different from the equivalent export in the icon.</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI>Arcs:
    <UL>
      <LI>Unnamed arcs that "dangle": one end is unconnected and unexported (does not apply to busses).</LI>
      <LI>Bus arcs whose width is inconsistent with its two nodes.</LI>
      <LI>Bus pins that "float": do not connect to bus arcs and are not exported.</LI>
      <LI>Bus pins that connect to more than 1 wire.</LI>
      <LI>Network names that differ only by their case (i.e. networks "A" and "a" are actually different networks).
    </UL>
  </LI>
</OL>
<P>
After analysis of the circuit,
you can review the errors by typing "&gt;" and "&lt;" to step to the next and previous error that was found.
You can also see a list of errors in the cell explorer (see <A HREF="chap04-05-02.html#chap04-05-02">Section 4-5-2</A>).
