BUG: (9/14/09, SMR) Explorer tree Library Search function doesn't close
     properly and needs an "Edit All Cells" button (Bug #2322).
FIX: Fixed closure and added button.

BUG: (9/11/09, AM) We need to agree on what "batch" means and how to
     launch Electric in headless mode (Bug #2375).
FIX: JonG says: "I think batch mode implies 'no GUI', and nothing
     more.".  Updated documentation and Main.java.

BUG: (9/11/09, AM) Garbled export names (Bug #2382).
FIX: Distinguish between HighlightLine instances which correspond to
     errors and those which do not.

IMP: (9/9/09, AM) Added a fast path to the BTree code when insertions
     are in key-increasing order.  Net speedup when loading simulation
     data: 74%.  Combined with two previous modifications: 96%
     improvement (time required is 4% of time previously required).

IMP: (9/9/09, AM) Change PageStorage to a zero-copy API, at the
     expense of doing more byte[] allocation.  This made it feasible
     to increase the default page size from 1024 bytes to just under
     4096 bytes (because the System.arraycopy()'s are no longer
     killing us).  Net result: 73% improvement in time to build BTree.
     Combined with previous modification: 84% improvement (time
     required is 26% of time previously required).

IMP: (9/9/09, AM) Store simulation data as BTree<Pair<Double,Double>>
     instead of two BTree<Double>'s.  Result: 43% improvement in time
     to build BTree.

IMP: (9/6/09, DN) Rename MultiTaskJobLight to MultiTaskJob, remove old
     MultiTaskJob.

BUG: (9/3/09, JKG) bug 2351, logical effort had hard coded assumed values for
     gate widths and lengths of the X=1 inverter. Those changed for 40nm.
     They are now specifiable as logical effort settings

IMP: (9/3/09, GVG) Build.xml modified to unjar Jython and to include it into
     electric.jar (ant jar).  That is to run Scripting regression in batch mode
     (part of Bug #2358)

BUG: (9/3/09, DN) Command line "-batch -s script.bsh" executes script without any
     EditingPreferences (Bug #2373)
FIX: In Main.InitDatabase.doIt assign factory-default EditingPreferences.

BUG: (9/2/09, DN) DRCUpdate is not executed in MultiDRC regressins.
FIX: In "DRC.DRCUpdate()" use "startJobOnMyResult()" instead of "startJob()".

IMP: (9/2/09, DN) Better regression diagnostics.

IMP: (9/2/09, DN) Explicit UserInterface object for each thread.

IMP: (9/2/09, GVG) More changes to get Jython working in the regressions (Bug
     #2358)

IMP: (9/1/09, AM) Change name of ScalarSignal to NewSignal (it is no

     In Undo.updateUndoRedo(), do not call showUndoRedoStatus() if in a text
     cell.

IMP: (8/31/09, SMR) User's Manual search highlights search keys.

IMP: (8/30/09, AM) Right-align signal names in the waveform viewer,
     and truncate from the left when necessary.  When a signal name is
     very long due to being deep in the hierarchy, the *rightmost*
     part of the signal name is most useful to the user.

IMP: (8/30/09, AM) Add a menu item to Window->WaveformWindow for each
     icon button in the waveform window.  Aside from acting as
     documentation, this makes it possible for users to add a
     keystroke for those buttons.

     in this case.

BUG: (8/27/09, DN) Pixel drawing algorithm not displaying LE result (Bug #2359)
FIX: In PixelDrawing.drawNode replace "varContext.pop();" by
     "varContext = varContext.pop();".

FIX: Fix vector conversion and disable editing of noneditable technologies.

BUG: (8/22/09, AM) Annotation text not selectable in a certain situation (Bug
     #2352)
FIX: com.sun.electric.tool.user.Highlighter.findTextNow() must pass
     all text to EditWindow.setTextInCell(), THEN filter out the text
     that is not visible (rather than in the other order).

BUG: (8/19/09, DN) fill generator does not replace old versions of existing fill
     cells (Bug #2342).
FIX: In Cell.kill() remove all instances of killed Cell.
     In StitchFillJob.cleanReplacement copy all instances in a temporary list
     before starting modification.

************************* Version 8.10e: ******************************

IMP: (8/18/09, SMR) Added Placement tool.

BUG: (8/18/09, SMR) Moving diagonal arcs may break them (Bug #2341).

     to them are NOT selected.

BUG: (8/17/09, AM) Pulsating error highlighting causes 100% CPU usage
     (Bug #2348)
FIX: Use a javax.swing.Timer instead of repaint requests.

BUG: (8/17/09, GVG) Fill generator is not putting enough contacts in when
     connecting to cell instance (Bug #2340)
FIX: Adding nodes in SearchInHierarchy.

BUG: (8/17/09, SMR) If two arcs are in a line, meeting at an end (not sharing
     a pin, but each having their own pin, and the pins are coincident)
     then it is not possible to select the two arcs and use right-click
     to wire them.  Instead, all points are wired to (0,0) (Bug #2339).
FIX: In "InteractiveRouter.getIntersection()" the parallel but intersecting
     case is now handled.

     next error.  Jon Gainsley: please verify this! (Bug #2338).

IMP: (8/16/09, AM) Add pulsating error highlighting.  This is
     useful because using motion to direct the user's attention (rather
     than color) works with any color scheme.

IMP: (8/15/09, AM) Add "duplicate in place" option.  When this is
     enabled, the "duplicate" command will place the duplicated object
     exactly where the original was.  This is far more useful than the
     default behavior when you have layout geometry that needs to stay
     on a grid.

IMP: (8/12/09, AM) use BTree in ScalarEpicAnalysis.  It works.  But it
     is slow.

IMP: (8/11/09, AM) add JDBM-based implementation of BTree (temporary,
     just to get something working quickly).

     contacts (Bug #2323)

BUG: (8/5/09, JKG) Fixes for node extraction. PURELAYERNODEMODE in node
     extractor, probably should be preference. Changes to auto-stitcher used by
     node extractor. (Bugs #2183, #2239)
     (1) changed conditions for forcing an arc to have no head/tail extends
        (RouteElementArc.java)
     (2) more code for aligning to grid, for node extraction
        (InteractiveRouter.java)
     (3) fixes for node extractor, mostly in re-exporting up the hierarchy
         (AutoStitch.java)
     (4) purelayernodemode that extracts mostly pure layer nodes. lots of fixes
         (Connectivity.java)

IMP: (8/5/09, JKG) fix for null color in LayerDrawing.java

     not Pdiff arc (same for N-Well-con) (Bug #2319)
FIX: Ports fixed for those well contacts defined in a generic way.

IMP: (8/4/09, SMR) When placing a node from the component menu, typing "," or
     "." before clicking rotates the node's initial orientation (Bug #2253).

BUG: (8/4/09, SMR) "Change" dialog takes too long when changing arcs with nodes

     (Bug #1787)

IMP: (1/15/09, RK) NCC uses tolerances specified in "Size checking"
     section of NCC preferences pane in order to decide when
     transistor widths and lengths are close enough to combine in
     series / parallel. (Bug #1980)

IMP: (1/13/09, RK) I removed the backwards compatibility hack in NCC that
     infers NodeProto.Function from the name of the PrimitiveNode.
     This removed the references to TRANMOS and TRAPMOS in NCC. However
     to do this, I needed to update the Technologies: MoCMOS and CMOS90
     so they correctly use the new NodeProto.Functions. (Bug #1858)

BUG: (1/13/09, SMR) Pad Frame generator fails if core cell has a view (Bug
     #2001).
FIX: In PadGenerator.createPadFrame(), do not append view if one exists.

IMP: (1/13/09, RK) I changed the implementation of
     Technology.getTransistorBiasPort(NodeInst ni) so that MoCMOS
     transistors also return the body contact. I changed the MoCMOS
     constructor to allow well arcs to attach to well contacts. I added
     an option to NCC to enable the checking of body contacts. I changed
     NCC so it optionally checks body contacts. I added body checking
     tests to NCC regression. I added body checking documentation to
     the NCC user's manual. (Bug #1910)

FIX: Fixed code that compares part of route with previous parts of same route.

IMP: (1/9/08, SMR) Added new command: "Export / Manipulate Exports..."
     which displays exports in cell in a dialog.  One of the buttons in this
     dialog is "Renumber Selected Numeric Export Names" which takes a set
     of numeric exports (i.e. exports with numeric suffixes, such as "gnd_1",
     "gnd_3", etc.) and renumbers the suffixes so that they have no gaps and
     start with an unnumbered name (Bug #1465, 1526).

IMP: (1/9/08, SMR) Verilog netlister now uses backslash notation for busses
     with gaps (Bug #1523).

BUG: (1/8/08, SMR) Creating a new attribute doesn't include settings in dialog (Bug #1528).
FIX: In Attributes.CreateAttribute constructor, build initial TextDescriptor.

IMP: (1/8/08, DN) ImmutableArcInst is technology independent.

IMP (1/7/08, SMR) Improved "Arc Properties" and "Node Properties" dialogs
     so that the current bus arc/port's members can be listed (Bug #1529).

IMP: (1/7/08, SMR) Array command remembers all settings in preferences (Bug #1527).

BUG: (1/6/08, DN) Compilation error in TechPool on Java 1.5.
FIX: Copy AbstarctMap.SimpleImmutableEntry class from Java 1.6 into database.text directory.

IMP: (1/5/08, DN) Added TechPool class which is a map from TechId to Technology.

BUG: (1/3/08, SMR) Adding AC or DC signals to the waveform window brings
     them up in a Transient panel, and they are not remembered (#1469).
FIX: Set the panel type correctly when creating them.

BUG: (1/3/08, SMR) Node/Arc/Export Properties sometimes truncates data.
FIX: Must pack dialogs when reloading them.

BUG: (1/3/08, DN) Crash reading HSpice ".mt0" file.
FIX: In HSpiceOut.addMeasurmentData prepare common "time" array.

IMP: (1/3/08, SMR) Improved "Select All/Next/Previous Like This" to handle
     text attributes (Bug #1519).

IMP: (1/3/08, DN) All *Id modules are moved to database.id package.

BUG: (1/3/08, SMR) Geometry extraction fails to handle rotated contacts (Bug #1475).
FIX: Added detection of asymetric contacts.

IMP: (12/28/07, DN) Offscreen buffer in waveform window is VolatileImage for faster repaint.

BUG: (12/27/07, DN) Dragging main/ext cursors in waveform window is slow when waveforms are large.
FIX: In user.waveform.Panel paint cursors directly to screen instead of offscreen buffer.

BUG: (12/26/07, DN) Ploting of .ac0 (ac analysis ) not working properly (Bug #1522).
FIX: Refactor simulation code so that it handles complex waveforms.
     Only amplitude plot is shown. Phase information is available internally,
     but GUI is still to be changed to show it.

IMP: (12/20/07, RK) Fix NCC regressions. qFourP2 had arc names that depended
     upon case insensitive matching.

BUG: (12/13/07, SMR) Spice still writes too many "'" wrappers (Bug #1452).
FIX: In Spice:replacePortsAndVars() to add quotes only if not already in them.

BUG: (12/17/07, SMR) EDIF input is inconsistent with cell names that start
     with an ampersand (Bug #1455 in the old Bugzilla, #1467 in the new one).
FIX: In EDIF input, all cell names, port names, and net names that start
     with & and a number have the ampersand removed.

BUG: (12/17/07, SMR) VHDL generation of layout transistors may miss the poly connection.
FIX: In GenerateVHDL.addRealPorts(), consider topological equivalences.

IMP: (12/05/07, DN) Only arcs with same name (in case-sensitive sense) are connected into same network.
    Warning if there are arcs with case-insensitive match. (Bug #1398).
